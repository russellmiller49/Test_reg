## Peripheral Bronchoscopy

Patient Name: Rachel Anderson
MRN: 3849571
Date of Procedure: January 3, 2019

Proceduralist(s): Thomas Wright, MD, Pulmonologist; Nicole Stevens, MD (Fellow)

Procedure(s) Performed:
• CPT 31629 Flexible bronchoscopy with fluoroscopic transbronchial needle aspiration
• CPT 31627 Bronchoscopy with computer assisted image guided navigation
• CPT 31654 Bronchoscopy with Endobronchial Ultrasound guidance for peripheral lesion
• CPT 31624 Bronchoscopy with bronchial alveolar lavage

Indications: Migratory lung nodules
Medications: General Anesthesia

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.

Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea was of normal caliber. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there were no endobronchial lesions. There were thick non-purulent secretions in multiple airways which were suctioned.

Following inspection, a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe with 180 cc instillation and 70 cc return. The SuperDimension navigational catheter was then inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using the navigational software, we were able to direct the catheter to within 1 cm of the left lingular lesion of interest. Radial ultrasound was then used to confirm location and a concentric view was seen indicating appropriate isolation of the lesion. TBNAs were performed under fluoroscopic observation and on ROSE numerous histiocytes and occasional giant cells were seen. Subsequently, further biopsies were performed with a triple needle brush and forceps biopsies under fluoroscopic observation. After samples were obtained and we were confident that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure concluded.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc

Recommendation:
• CXR to rule out pneumothorax
• Await pathology results

CASE PRESENTATION: Complex Navigation Bronchoscopy

PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS:
A 64-year-old male (Case ID: C-847, Synthetic Name: Martin Lee, MRN: QQ-8473-R, DOB: 05/22/1960) former smoker with 45 pack-year history presented with an incidentally discovered left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule.

IMAGING CHARACTERISTICS:
Computed tomography demonstrated a 17mm solid nodule in the left lower lobe superior segment without clear bronchus sign. Positron emission tomography revealed moderate FDG uptake with standardized uptake value of 3.9, raising concern for malignancy.

PROCEDURAL APPROACH:
Given the peripheral location and lack of visible bronchus sign, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was selected as the diagnostic modality.

Sedation Protocol:
Deep sedation was induced using propofol continuous infusion (target 50-75 mcg/kg/min) with placement of laryngeal mask airway for airway protection. Maximum Ramsay sedation score achieved was 4. Invasive blood pressure monitoring via radial arterial line provided continuous hemodynamic data.

Technical Details:
The electromagnetic navigation system (SuperDimension™) was employed with pre-procedural CT-to-body registration achieved with registration error <4mm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway planning identified optimal approach via left lower lobe superior segmental bronchus.

The extended working channel was advanced under electromagnetic guidance with periodic fluoroscopic confirmation. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe deployment initially demonstrated eccentric pattern, prompting repositioning. After adjustment, concentric echogenic pattern was achieved, confirming tool-in-lesion position.

Radiation Exposure:
Total fluoroscopy time: 7.2 minutes
Dose-area product: 268 cGy·cm²
(Elevated exposure due to multiple repositioning attempts)

Sampling Protocol:
Following tool-in-lesion confirmation, systematic sampling was performed:
- Transbronchial needle aspiration: 3 passes (21-gauge needle)
- Transbronchial forceps biopsy: 5 specimens
- Bronchial brush cytology: 2 samples

COMPLICATIONS:
Small apical pneumothorax (approximately 15% by volume) was identified on immediate post-procedural chest radiograph. Patient remained asymptomatic with stable oxygen saturation on room air. Conservative management with observation was elected. Repeat radiography at 4 hours demonstrated stable pneumothorax size. Patient discharged with next-day follow-up radiograph showing partial resolution.

QUALITY METRICS:
- Tool-in-lesion confirmation: Achieved
- Localization success: Yes (after repositioning)
- Sampling protocol adherence: Complete
- Diagnostic yield: Pending final pathology

DISCUSSION:
This case illustrates both the technical challenges and eventual success of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy for peripheral pulmonary lesions. The need for repositioning to achieve concentric EBUS pattern extended procedure time and radiation exposure but ultimately facilitated diagnostic sampling. The pneumothorax, while requiring observation, represents an accepted risk of transbronchial biopsy techniques.

**PROCEDURES:**
- EBUS-TBNA
- Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy
- Radial EBUS
- Transbronchial biopsies
- Endobronchial biopsies

**CONSENT:** Obtained - all risks discussed

**VENT:** PC mode, Pinsp 20, RR 12, PEEP 5, FiO2 50%, Pmean 14

**PROCEDURE:**

**PART 1: EBUS-TBNA**

EBUS scope inserted through ETT (8.0, 23cm).

**Mediastinal Survey:**

**Station 2R:** 7mm - not sampled

**Station 4R:** 24mm - hypoechoic, heterogeneous
- 22G needle x 5 passes
- ROSE: "Positive - squamous cell carcinoma"

**Station 4L:** 19mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 4 passes
- ROSE: "Positive - squamous cell carcinoma"

**Station 7:** 28mm - large, hypoechoic, necrotic areas visible
- 22G needle x 5 passes (some passes yielded necrotic material)
- ROSE: "Positive - squamous cell carcinoma, areas of necrosis"

**Station 10L:** 22mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 4 passes
- ROSE: "Positive - squamous cell carcinoma"

**Station 11L:** 18mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 3 passes
- ROSE: "Positive - squamous cell carcinoma"

**Assessment after EBUS:** Extensive N2/N3 disease. Primary still needs biopsy for confirmation.

**PART 2: AIRWAY INSPECTION**

EBUS scope removed. Standard bronchoscope inserted.

**Finding:** LLL orifice shows endobronchial tumor - exophytic mass nearly occluding orifice, friable appearance.

**Decision:** Obtain endobronchial biopsies directly (easier/safer than navigating to peripheral component).

**Endobronchial biopsies:** 6 specimens obtained from visible LLL tumor using standard forceps.

Moderate bleeding from biopsy site. Managed with:
- Wedging bronchoscope
- Epinephrine 1:10,000, 5mL instilled
- Held position x 2 minutes
- Bleeding resolved

**ROSE (endobronchial):** "Squamous cell carcinoma - consistent with nodal samples"

**PART 3: EMN TO PERIPHERAL COMPONENT**

Despite endobronchial component, decided to sample peripheral component as well for potentially better tissue for molecular testing.

SuperDimension EMN system used. CT from 03/05/2025 loaded.

**Registration:** Auto-registration, 7 points, adequate accuracy.

**Navigation:** Attempted to navigate to LLL superior segment (peripheral component of mass). However, significant tumor in proximal airway made navigation difficult. Guide advanced as far as possible but unable to reach planned target (remained ~15mm away per system).

**Radial EBUS:** Probe advanced through guide - visualized mass with eccentric pattern but adequate for sampling.

**Peripheral sampling:**
- Forceps biopsies x 5
- Brushings x 2

**ROSE:** "Squamous cell carcinoma - adequate for molecular testing"

**TOTAL TIME:** 58 minutes

**FINDINGS SUMMARY:**

**Based on Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):**

**Primary Tumor:**
- Left lower lobe mass: ADENOCARCINOMA confirmed

**Lymph Node Staging:**
- Station 5 (Aortopulmonary window - contralateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N3 disease)
- Station 7 (Subcarinal - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N2 disease)
- Station 10L (Left hilar - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N1 disease)

**Preliminary Staging:**
- Primary tumor (T): T2b (3.6 cm)
- Regional lymph nodes (N): N3 (contralateral mediastinal node involvement)
- Distant metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastases identified on PET/CT)
- **Overall Stage: IIIB (T2bN3M0)**

This represents locally advanced disease with contralateral mediastinal lymph node involvement.
**CLINICAL ASSESSMENT & DISCUSSION:**

**Diagnosis:** Stage IIIB Adenocarcinoma of the Left Lower Lobe

**Significance:**
- This is locally advanced lung cancer with extensive nodal involvement
- N3 disease (contralateral mediastinal node) makes this unresectable by surgical standards
- Patient is NOT a surgical candidate given extent of nodal disease
- Will require systemic therapy +/- radiation

**Prognostic Factors - FAVORABLE:**
- Former smoker (quit 8 years ago) - intermediate prognosis
- Good performance status (ECOG 1)
- Age 61 - relatively young
- Histology: Adenocarcinoma (better prognosis than squamous, more treatment options)

**Prognostic Factors - UNFAVORABLE:**
- Stage IIIB with N3 disease
- Large primary tumor (3.6 cm)
- Multilevel nodal involvement (N1, N2, N3)

**Treatment Implications:**
- Primary treatment: Concurrent chemoimmunotherapy followed by consolidation immunotherapy (PACIFIC trial paradigm)
- Alternative: Sequential chemotherapy → radiation, or clinical trial
- Role of radiation: Definitive radiation therapy to primary + involved nodal stations
- Surgical resection: Not indicated given N3 disease
- Molecular testing results will be CRITICAL:
  - If EGFR/ALK/ROS1 positive: Consider targeted therapy incorporation
  - PD-L1 status: Guides immunotherapy selection
  - Other actionable mutations: May have clinical trial options

**Awaiting:**
- Final histopathology confirmation (2-3 business days)
- Comprehensive molecular testing (7-14 days, expedite if possible)
- Formal staging completion (see below)
**PLAN & FOLLOW-UP:**

**1. Staging Completion:**
- **Brain MRI with contrast** - Order STAT (high priority in adenocarcinoma, screen for brain metastases which would upstage to Stage IV)
- Review PET/CT from 04/02/2025:
  - Confirm adequate coverage of chest/abdomen/pelvis
  - No suspicious distant lesions
  - If any concerning findings, consider dedicated imaging
- Consider bone scan if bone pain or elevated alkaline phosphatase (though PET usually adequate)

**2. Pathology & Molecular Testing:**
- Monitor for final pathology report (should be available 04/18 or 04/19)
- **EXPEDITE molecular testing** - contact pathology to prioritize
  - EGFR, ALK, ROS1 (highest priority)
  - PD-L1 (critical for immunotherapy decisions)
  - Broader NGS panel
- Call patient with preliminary results once available

**3. Multidisciplinary Tumor Board:**
- **Present case at Thoracic Oncology Tumor Board** - Next meeting 04/23/2025

**CONSULT QUESTION:**
"Patient with known metastatic breast cancer, now with new RLL nodule. Concern for lung metastasis vs new primary. Please evaluate and biopsy if appropriate. Also noted to have enlarged subcarinal node."

**HISTORY:**
74F with PMH of Stage II ER+/HER2- invasive ductal breast carcinoma diagnosed 2017, treated with lumpectomy + radiation + endocrine therapy. Developed bone and liver metastases 2023, currently on palbociclib + letrozole with stable disease.

Recent surveillance CT shows new 2.8cm RLL nodule (not present on prior CT 6 months ago). Also new subcarinal lymphadenopathy 2.1cm. PET/CT: RLL nodule SUV 6.4, subcarinal node SUV 5.9.

Clinical question: Progression of breast cancer to lung vs. new primary lung cancer (would change management significantly).

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Combined EBUS-TBNA + EMN bronchoscopy for tissue diagnosis with appropriate immunohistochemistry to differentiate breast metastasis vs primary lung cancer.

Patient agreeable, scheduled for procedure same day given oncologic urgency.
**PROCEDURE PERFORMED:**

**EBUS-TBNA + EMN Bronchoscopy + Transbronchial Biopsy**

Consent obtained. Anesthesia: MAC (Dr. Roberts). ETT 7.5.

**PHASE 1 - EBUS:**

Surveyed mediastinum systematically.

- Brushings x 3
- BAL

ROSE: "Adenocarcinoma. Morphology could represent either primary lung or breast metastasis. IHC panel will be definitive."

No complications. CXR: no PTX.

**IMPRESSION:**
Adenocarcinoma in both subcarinal node and RLL nodule. Awaiting IHC to determine if breast metastasis vs primary lung cancer.

If breast metastasis → continue systemic breast cancer therapy
If primary lung cancer → separate staging/treatment approach needed

**PLAN:**
- IHC panel expedited (results expected 05/09)
- Contact patient with results
- Tumor board if lung primary confirmed
- Close communication with medical oncology

Patient: Sarah Martinez
MRN: 8472951
Date of Procedure: May 19, 2025
Preoperative Diagnosis: Hemoptysis with subcarinal mass
Postoperative Diagnosis: Malignant central airway obstruction
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking

CPT Codes:
• 31641: Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, with destruction of tumor or relief of stenosis (laser therapy, cryotherapy)
• 31640: Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, with excision of tumor

Surgeon: Robert Chen, MD
Assistant: Sean Foley, MD (Attending)
Indications: Hemoptysis, significant airway obstruction, and need for tissue biopsy
Consent: Informed consent obtained from patient and family after detailed explanation of the procedure, associated risks, benefits, and alternatives.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
Following induction of general anesthesia and insertion of an LMA, topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway. A T190 video bronchoscope was then advanced orally through the LMA into the tracheobronchial tree. Initial inspection revealed normal vocal cords and subglottic space. Significant fresh and clotted blood was present throughout the airway. The proximal and mid trachea appeared normal. The distal trachea and main carina demonstrated extensive friable tumor infiltration causing combined extrinsic and intrinsic obstruction—approximately 15% in the distal trachea, 50% in the proximal left mainstem bronchus, and up to 75% in the right mainstem bronchus. After copious suctioning, the left mainstem bronchus beyond the subcarinal region was clear and normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed diffuse tumor infiltration causing up to 90% obstruction proximally and extending into the proximal right upper lobe bronchus with approximately 85% obstruction. Distal to this region, the airways appeared uninvolved, including the bronchus intermedius, right middle, and lower lobes.

The video bronchoscope and LMA were then removed. A 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth and advanced into the distal trachea. Jet ventilation was initiated via the Monsoon ventilator. Using a therapeutic bronchoscope inserted through the rigid scope, cryotherapy was performed to remove adherent thick clots.

Subsequently, the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was utilized to visualize and biopsy the large subcarinal mass. Five transbronchial needle aspirations (TBNA) were conducted using the Olympus Vizishot 2 EBUS TBNA 22-gauge needle. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignant cells. Flexible forceps biopsies were also obtained from visible endobronchial tumor and specimens were preserved in formalin.

The tumor, which was friable and prone to bleeding, was debulked using Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) for cautery and mechanical debulking through the rigid bronchoscope. After extensive debulking, significant improvement was achieved: the left mainstem bronchus residual obstruction reduced to approximately 10%, and the right mainstem bronchus reduced to approximately 25%.

Persistent diffuse oozing from the tumor bed prompted instillation of 6 cc topical tranexamic acid via flexible bronchoscope. Persistent bleeding was controlled by direct application of three Surgicel pledgets for approximately one minute, successfully achieving hemostasis.

Following verification of hemostasis, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and patient care was transitioned back to anesthesia.

Complications: None
Estimated Blood Loss: 30 cc

Post-procedure Recommendations:
- Admit to ICU overnight for close observation and continuation of nebulized tranexamic acid
- Await pathology results
- Upon receipt of preliminary pathology, prompt multidisciplinary discussion with radiation oncology and medical oncology recommended to initiate treatment planning and prevent tumor recurrence and further airway compromise

Patient Name: Michael Thompson
MRN: 7294163
Date of Procedure: March 1, 2021

Preoperative Diagnosis: Malignant central airway obstruction
Postoperative Diagnosis: Resolved airway obstruction s/p silicone Y-stent
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking and silicone tracheobronchial Y-stent placement

Surgeon: Jennifer Williams, MD
Indications: Airway obstruction
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient's family acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives, a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope insertion was attempted. Due to poor mouth opening and glottic irregularities (related to previous head and neck radiation), we were unable to pass the large rigid bronchoscope through the cords and had to convert to a 12 mm rigid ventilating bronchoscope which was advanced past the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to jet ventilator. Unfortunately, due to a combination of extremely poor dentition and poor mouth opening, two teeth were lost during the intubation procedure.

Airway inspection was performed using the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope. The upper trachea was normal. The mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction. The distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstems with carinal tumor infiltration as well. The distal trachea was about 20% patent. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent. It appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue with only mild extrinsic compression.

Tumor debulking was performed using APC to "burn and shave" the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.

Once we were able to bypass the central tumor, the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1 cm past the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left-sided bronchi were normal and fully patent. The right mainstem involvement was also limited to the first cm past the main carina. There was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, but the right-sided airways were otherwise uninvolved.

After measuring the airways, we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65 mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb, and 40 mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid, and using Freitag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb, we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea. The rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope, we were eventually able to seat the stent into proper position. Post-insertion, the trachea, right mainstem, and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent. We then removed the rigid bronchoscope and turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery.

Recommendations:
- Transfer back to ICU
- Post-procedure x-ray
- Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance
- Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified
- Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge
- If invasive ventilatory support is required, blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction. Intubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.

Attending: Russell J. Miller, MD
Anesthesia: General Anesthesia
Monitoring: Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

Instrument:
• Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
• Ion Robotic Bronchoscope

Estimated Blood Loss: Minimum
Complications: None

Procedure in Detail:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.

Navigation and Targeting:
A CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform. Robotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.

Cone Beam CT Imaging:
A cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.

Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):
A TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.

Transbronchial Cryobiopsy:
Transbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1 mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):
A BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.

Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):
ROSE from the Ion procedure revealed atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process.

Additional BAL:
After completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.

Chartis Evaluation:
A Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

Specimen(s):
• TBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture
• Transbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture
• BAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology

Impression/Plan: Douglas Diaz is a 74-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.

Recommendations:
• Transfer to PACU
• Obtain chest X-ray
• Discharge home once cleared by PACU
• Await pathology and culture results and based on findings follow up for EBV insertion for COPD

Patient Name: James Patterson
MRN: 4726193
Date: May 29, 2019

Preoperative Diagnosis: Endotracheal tumor
Postoperative Diagnosis: Endotracheal tumor s/p debulking
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation (CPT 31641)

Surgeon: Patricia Lee, MD
Assistant: Marcus Johnson, MD
Indications: Tracheal obstruction
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics, the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords, there were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation, resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway. Additionally, there were multiple small polypoid (>50) lesions surrounding and distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1 cm proximal to the main carina. The right-sided and left-sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction.

The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions. The lesions, once free from the wall, were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed, about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure, the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications.

Of note, we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect as the lesions regrew very quickly (<3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure. However, in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure, he expressed reluctance to have a stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation, and if I need to debulk again, I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.

Recommendations:
• Transfer patient back to ward room
• Await final pathology results
• Will need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy

I, Patricia Lee, MD, was present and actively involved in all phases of the procedure.

Patient Name: Christopher Hayes
MRN: 9274183
Date of Procedure: June 15, 2020

Preoperative Diagnosis: Bronchial stenosis secondary to Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Postoperative Diagnosis: Bronchial stenosis secondary to Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy

Surgeon: Kevin Martinez, MD
Indications: Left mainstem obstruction
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. I-gel LMA was placed for initial airway inspection and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal. The upper trachea was normal. The distal third of the trachea was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern but without any endoluminal obstruction. On the right, there was minimal structuring of the bronchus intermedius. On the left, the proximal mainstem was about 90% obstructed circumferentially, and approximately 1 cm into the left mainstem the airway was completely occluded.

Radial knife cuts were performed within the proximal left mainstem followed by attempted CRE balloon dilatation. However, due to the proximal obstruction, dilatation was difficult as only the balloon tip could be inserted into the left mainstem due to the complete distal obstruction. We attempted to place a guide wire through the obstruction as well but unsuccessfully.

The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. At this point, we performed APC to the left mainstem followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue which we repeated multiple times attempting to slowly recanalize the airway. We periodically would reinsert the CRE balloon and dilate as the airway lumen slowly reopened, but we were unable to visualize any distal airway. This was performed in a slow methodical fashion given the concern for airway perforation without obvious distal airway targets. However, once we had dilated approximately 3 cm into the left mainstem, a pulsatile vessel was seen which was likely the pulmonary artery through a small (2 mm) false lumen. The PA was intact and there was no evidence of rupture.

At this point, to protect from major vascular bleeding, we instilled fibrin glue into the left mainstem, after which we removed the rigid bronchoscope and intubated the patient. Chest radiograph was performed which showed his previously elevated left hemi-diaphragm was significantly lower and there was a questionable deep sulcus concerning for pneumothorax. In the setting of a known airway tear and need for positive pressure ventilation, we felt that chest tube placement was warranted. After prepping the left mid-axillary area, a 14F pigtail catheter was placed without complications and the patient was transferred to the PICU in stable condition.

Recommendations:
• Patient to remain intubated tonight
• CT surgery aware and will evaluate patient for possible pneumonectomy given airway injury and lack of viable lung
• Appreciate Rheumatology recommendations in regards to tapering immunosuppressives in anticipation of possible surgery
• Please obtain CT chest with contrast once stable to assist in planning for possible surgical intervention
• If patient develops significant hemoptysis tonight, place left side down, intubate right mainstem, call me (602-791-3135) and pediatric surgeon immediately
• We will continue to follow

Patient: Emily Richardson
MRN: 5183947
Date: April 8, 2022

Preoperative Diagnosis: Respiratory failure secondary to extrinsic tracheal compression
Postoperative Diagnosis: Extrinsic tracheal compression s/p airway stent placement
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy, Silicone Y-stent placement, bronchoscopic intubation

Surgeon: Laura Bennett, MD
Indications: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient's family prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated, a flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the ETT into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. Beginning in the mid trachea, inflammation was seen within the airway walls extending into the bilateral mainstem with approximately 90% obstruction (at maximum) of the tracheal lumen most prominent in the mid trachea with less extensive obstruction extending to approximately 2 cm above the carina. There was no endobronchial tumor.

We subsequently removed the flexible bronchoscope and after administration of paralytics, a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supraglottic space. The previously placed endotracheal tube was visualized passing through the vocal cords. Under direct visualization, the endotracheal tube was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The Q190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways.

After measuring the airways, we customized a 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 75 mm in the tracheal limb, 15 mm in the right mainstem limb, and 30 mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope, we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.

At this point, inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway obstruction. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway, the LMA was removed and the procedure was complete.

Post-procedure Diagnosis: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression s/p successful deployment of silicone tracheal Y-stent

Recommendations:
• Transfer to ICU
• Obtain post-procedure CXR
• TID hypertonic nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent

Patient: Brian Foster
MRN: 6927483
Date of Procedure: December 7, 2016

Preoperative Diagnosis: Lung mass with left mainstem obstruction
Postoperative Diagnosis: Malignant mixed intrinsic and extrinsic airway obstruction
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy

Surgeon: Daniel Carter, MD
Assistant: Monica Taylor, MD
Indications: Left mainstem obstruction
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by anesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope.

On initial bronchoscopic inspection, there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction.

At this point, the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was identified with ultrasound. Six biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left mainstem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy, and forceps, we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. An ultrathin bronchoscope was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carinas within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized, but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor overlying this area to confirm distal patency.

Subsequently, the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an 8-9-10 CRE balloon with approximately 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem, which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point, the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea, and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.

Recommendations:
• Await tissue diagnosis
• ASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction
• If patient develops significant hemoptysis post-procedure, would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung
• If obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy, will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y-stent

Preoperative Diagnosis: Tracheal and bronchial stenosis secondary to Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Postoperative Diagnosis: Tracheal and bronchial stenosis secondary to Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Procedure Performed: Flexible bronchoscopy with radial knife incisions and balloon dilatation

Surgeon: Gregory Hamilton, MD
Indications: Tracheal and bronchial stenosis
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. An I-gel LMA was placed and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal. The subglottic space was normal. Approximately 3 cm below the vocal cords, there was a long segment stenotic lesion which was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern measuring 5 cm in length. The maximal obstruction within the long segment was approximately 60% with an endoluminal diameter of 6-7 mm. There were no simple strictures associated with the stenosis. The carina was sharp.

On the right, there were mucosal changes/erythema without obstruction on the posterior wall of the right mainstem and at the entrance to the right upper lobe. The right upper lobe and mainstem appeared unaffected. The bronchus intermedius was mostly unaffected with small mucosal irregularities. The right middle lobe was minimally narrowed without significant obstruction. There was mild stricturing on the right lower lobe orifice (approximately 10% obstruction). The medial basal segment of the right lower lobe was concentrically obstructed from stricture with only a pinpoint opening (95% occluded). A similar circumferential obstruction was seen at the orifice of the superior segment (80% occluded). The anterior, lateral, and posterior basal segments were partially obstructed from stricture (50%).

On the left, the mainstem was normal. The left upper lobe proper was normal. The lingula was obstructed at the orifice by a similar appearing circumferential obstruction (50% occluded). The superior segment of the left lower lobe was also minimally obstructed from stricture (15% obstructed). The basal segments of the left lower lobe were unaffected.

Following inspection, we then brought our attention to the tracheal stenosis and serial dilatations were performed with 3 cm length with a 12, 13.5, 15 CRE balloon with post-dilatation obstruction of 25% of normal airway. We then inserted the electrocautery knife through the working channel and cuts were made to the band-like strictures within the lingula, the superior segment of the right lower lobe, medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, and anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe. Serial dilatations were performed using the 6, 7, 8 CRE balloon to the lingula, the superior segment of the right lower lobe, medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, and anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe with near complete recanalization of the segments, after which the flexible bronchoscope could easily be passed into the segments. At this point, once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

Recommendations:
• Patient to PACU for recovery
• Patient to follow up with me PRN if symptoms return

===============================================================================
This seventy-three year old female patient Catherine Martinez (medical record JJ-8374-Q, born September 8, 1951) presented for electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy targeting a left upper lobe peripheral nodule measuring twenty-three millimeters in greatest dimension on computed tomography. The lesion demonstrated a positive bronchus sign and had a standardized uptake value of five point two on positron emission tomography imaging suggesting malignancy. She underwent moderate conscious sedation with intravenous midazolam three milligrams and fentanyl one hundred micrograms achieving a Ramsay sedation score of three. Her blood pressure was monitored at ten minute intervals throughout and remained stable in the one twenties to one thirties over seventies to eighties. Oxygen saturation was continuously monitored and stayed above ninety-five percent on room air. The electromagnetic navigation system was utilized with successful registration to the preoperative CT scan. The guide sheath was advanced to the left upper lobe apical-posterior segment and the radial endobronchial ultrasound probe confirmed tool-in-lesion position with a concentric echogenic pattern consistent with solid tissue. Total fluoroscopy time was five point one minutes with a dose area product of one hundred ninety-two centigray centimeters squared. Sampling included three needle aspirations using a twenty-one gauge needle, four transbronchial forceps biopsies, and two brush cytology specimens.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After induction of general anesthesia maintaining spontaneous ventilation, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT POSITION: Supine with shoulder roll, neck extended
A 3.5mm Storz pediatric rigid bronchoscope was introduced via the mouth under direct laryngoscopy. The vocal cords were visualized and appeared normal with symmetric movement. The bronchoscope was advanced through the cords into the trachea.
Initial Survey:

Larynx: Normal
Vocal cords: Normal, symmetric movement
Trachea: Normal caliber, no lesions
Carina: Sharp, normal

The bronchoscope was advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. A foreign body was visualized 2cm distal to the carina - a tan-brown, irregular object consistent with a peanut fragment, approximately 8mm in size. The foreign body was partially occluding the right mainstem bronchus with surrounding mucosal edema and mild erythema.
Foreign Body Retrieval:
Optical forceps were advanced through the rigid bronchoscope. The peanut fragment was grasped carefully. Initial attempt at retrieval showed the fragment was somewhat friable. The fragment was gently manipulated and brought into the rigid bronchoscope barrel to prevent fragmentation. The bronchoscope and forceps with the foreign body were withdrawn as a single unit.
The foreign body was removed intact - a peanut fragment measuring approximately 8mm x 5mm.
The bronchoscope was reintroduced for inspection:

Right mainstem: Mild mucosal edema and erythema at the site, no residual foreign material
Right upper lobe: Patent
Right middle lobe: Patent
Right lower lobe: Patent with moderate secretions
Left lung: Examined and found to be normal

Secretions were suctioned from the right lower lobe. No other foreign material was identified. Final inspection showed:

Complete foreign body removal
Mild mucosal trauma with no active bleeding
Patent bilateral airways

The bronchoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room.
The attending, Dr. Martinez, was present throughout the entire procedure.

Light was continuously delivered for the calculated duration. During light application:

Laser energy meter verified consistent power output
No visible tissue changes during light delivery (expected)
No charring or thermal effects observed (confirming non-thermal mechanism)
Patient hemodynamically stable throughout
No arrhythmias or desaturations

Post-Treatment Assessment:
Immediately following light delivery, the treated area appeared essentially unchanged (expected for PDT). No immediate edema, no bleeding. The fiber was removed and the bronchoscope withdrawn.
Light Precautions Review:
Post-procedure, the following light precautions were reviewed with patient and family:

Strict avoidance of direct sunlight and bright indoor lights for 30 days minimum
Wear protective clothing, wide-brimmed hat, gloves when outdoors
Gradual re-exposure to normal light starting day 30 with skin testing
Emergency contact information provided
Written instructions given

The patient tolerated the procedure well. Extubated in the OR without difficulty. Transferred to PACU in stable condition.
SPECIMENS
None (non-excisional therapy)
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
This 71-year-old female with early-stage endobronchial squamous cell carcinoma (biopsy-proven 9/15/2024) underwent photodynamic therapy light application session without complications.
Timeline for Follow-up Bronchoscopy:

Scheduled debridement bronchoscopy: October 14, 2024 (48 hours post-light)
Anticipated findings: Necrotic tumor debris requiring mechanical removal
Will assess treatment response and obtain biopsies from treatment bed

Ongoing Management:

Continue light precautions (patient education reinforced)
Monitor for post-PDT complications: airway edema, photosensitivity reactions
Dexamethasone 4mg PO BID x 5 days (reduce airway inflammation)
PPI therapy (reduce risk of esophageal photosensitivity)
Debridement session in 2 days

Long-term surveillance:
Bronchoscopic surveillance at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment per protocol.
Procedure Note - EBV Removal
Patient Michael Torres 59M MRN 1589403, October 15 2024, Dr. Amanda Foster attending
Indication: Patient had Zephyr valves placed in RUL 6 months ago for emphysema. Developed recurrent pneumonias and productive cough. Decision made to remove valves.
Patient brought to OR under general anesthesia with 8.5 ETT. Bronchoscope introduced. Right upper lobe examined - all three valves visible and in good position but significant mucous plugging noted distal to valves.
Valve 1 (RB1 apical segment): Grasped with retrieval forceps, removed without difficulty. Some mucous plug came out with valve.
Valve 2 (RB2 posterior segment): This one had granulation tissue at the rim. Used forceps to remove valve, small amount bleeding from granulation tissue controlled with epinephrine and ice saline.
Valve 3 (RB3 anterior segment): Removed easily with forceps.
After valve removal the RUL segments were suctioned extensively. Thick secretions cleared. Mucosa was edematous but no active bleeding. Airways now patent.
Left lung examined - normal. Patient tolerated well, extubated, transferred to recovery.
Specimens: 3 Zephyr valves (not sent to pathology per protocol, retained for documentation), mucous plugs sent for culture.
Follow up: CXR in AM. Likely improved ventilation to RUL now. Patient understands FEV1 may decrease as we've reversed the lung volume reduction effect but pneumonia risk should improve. Will see in clinic 2 weeks.

Bronchoscopy Note
Patient: Jennifer Wu, 58 yo female
Date: October 17, 2024
Doc: Dr. Steven Park
MRN: 1690514
So Ms. Wu came in today for her routine stent check. She's about 3 months out from when we placed that 14mm Dumon silicone stent in her left mainstem for malignant compression from lung cancer. She's been doing pretty well overall, no new dyspnea, though she mentioned maybe a bit more cough the last week or so.
Brought her over to the procedure room, gave her moderate sedation with the usual versed and fentanyl, topped up with some propofol. Once she was comfortable we got the scope in through her trach (she ended up needing a trach about 2 weeks after the stent because of overall disease progression).
So here's what I found: The trachea above the stent looks okay, maybe a touch more secretions than last time but nothing crazy. The stent itself is still in good position - hasn't migrated at all which is great. But there's definitely more mucous buildup than I'd like to see. Spent a good 10 minutes doing aggressive suctioning and toilet of the stent lumen. Got a bunch of thick tan-colored secretions out.
After cleaning it out I could see the proximal end of the stent has some mild granulation tissue forming - maybe 10% of the circumference, not enough to cause obstruction yet but something we'll need to watch. Thought about hitting it with APC today but honestly it wasn't causing any flow limitation so I decided to just keep an eye on it.
The distal end of the stent is sitting right where it should be. I could see the LUL and LLL takeoffs through the stent - both still patent. The tumor outside the stent looks about the same as last time, maybe slightly more bulky but hard to say. Stent is doing its job keeping the airway open though, I'd estimate we still have about 80% patency which is solid.
Did a quick peek at the right side while I was in there - everything looks normal, no new issues.
Recommendations going forward: I think we need to bring her back a bit sooner than usual, maybe 4 weeks instead of 8, just to make sure that granulation tissue doesn't get out of hand. Also talked to her about increasing her nebulizer treatments to help keep secretions looser. Started her on a 5 day course of azithromycin since the secretions looked a bit purulent.
Overall I'm happy with how the stent is functioning. The main challenge is going to be managing secretion burden and staying on top of any granulation tissue. Patient tolerated the procedure well, no complications, she'll follow up with me in 4 weeks.

EMERGENCY BRONCHOSCOPY - HEMOPTYSIS
10/23/24 - 02:35AM
Pt: Marcus Johnson, 57M, MRN 1923847
CALLED FOR: Massive hemoptysis, ICU bed 8
Got called by ICU resident at 2am - patient with known left upper lobe cavitary lesion (likely TB vs fungal) started having massive hemoptysis, estimated 300cc bright red blood over 20 minutes. Oxygen sats dropping to high 80s. Already intubated by ICU team with 8.0 ETT.
RUSHED TO BEDSIDE
Arrived 02:15. Patient sedated on propofol/fent. Sats 91% on FiO2 100%, PEEP 10. Significant blood coming from ETT with suctioning.
SCOPE FINDINGS:
ETT in good position. Massive blood in trachea - suctioned approximately 50cc out just to see.
RIGHT SIDE: Clean, no blood, all segments patent and normal
LEFT SIDE: This is the source. Heavy bleeding coming from LUL. Can't see individual segments yet due to blood volume.
INITIAL MEASURES:

Iced saline lavage: 50cc aliquots x 4 = 200cc total through scope
Some temporary improvement but bleeding continues
Epi 1:10,000: 10cc instilled to LUL - minimal effect
Tranexamic acid: 500mg in 50mL saline instilled via bronch - slight reduction

BALLOON TAMPONADE:
Blood still coming. Advanced 7Fr Fogarty balloon catheter to LUL orifice. Inflated with 6cc saline. IMMEDIATE cessation of blood flow. Good seal.
Kept balloon inflated for 5 minutes. Deflated to check - slight oozing but much slower. Re-inflated for another 5 minutes.
Second deflation - persistent slow oozing from what looks like lingula now that I can see better. Advanced balloon to lingular orifice. Inflated with 4cc. Held 3 minutes. Deflated - bleeding stopped.
FINAL ASSESSMENT @ 03:15AM:
After tamponade cycles, bleeding under control. Can now visualize - appears to be coming from anterior segment LUL and lingula. Mucosa very friable. Likely bleeding from cavitary lesion eroding into vessels.
SPECIMENS: Blood sent for culture (TB, fungal)
PLAN:

ICU team notified - called IR for possible BAE (bronchial artery embolization)
Keep intubated, sedate, minimize suctioning
Reverse any coagulopathy (check labs)
CTA chest to identify bleeding vessel
IR consulted - agree with BAE plan, going to angio suite at 6am
I'll be on standby if rebleeds before IR
If rebleeds: will place endobronchial blocker to LUL for longer-term isolation

UPDATE 03:45AM: Patient stable, no further bleeding currently. IR taking to angio suite. Will follow up later this AM.

Surrogate indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was obtained.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prolonged mechanical ventilation; ARDS
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same
PROCEDURE: Tracheostomy, Planned (Percutaneous, Bronchoscopic Assistance) (CPT 31600)
ATTENDING: Dr. Jennifer Taylor
ASSISTANT: Dr. Mark Stevens, Fellow
Support Staff:

RN: Amanda White
RT: Christopher Lee

ANESTHESIA: Propofol and Fentanyl infusions (patient already intubated and sedated)
MONITORING: ICU monitoring with continuous pulse oximetry, arterial line, telemetry
INSTRUMENT: Olympus bronchoscope, Ciaglia Blue Rhino percutaneous tracheostomy kit, 8.0 Shiley cuffed tracheostomy tube
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 20 mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT POSITION: Supine with neck extension (shoulder roll)
The bronchoscope was introduced through the existing 8.0 ETT into the trachea. The bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization. The inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized and counted.
With bronchoscopic visualization, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1% 3ml was injected into the anterior neck for local anesthesia. A 1cm vertical skin incision was made with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.
A syringe with 1% Lidocaine was attached to the introducer needle and passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings into the trachea under direct visualization. Aspiration of air confirmed tracheal entry. The needle was removed and the 18-gauge introducer catheter over needle was advanced into this position under direct visualization.
The inner needle was removed and the introducer catheter left in place. A J-wire was passed through the catheter, visualized with the bronchoscope entering the tracheal lumen. The site was dilated using the 14Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire.
The 14Fr dilator was removed and an 8Fr guiding catheter placed over the guide wire until the safety ridge on the guiding catheter was at skin level. The Blue Rhino dilator was placed over the guiding catheter and advanced until the positioning mark (corresponding to 8.0 trach size) was visualized via the bronchoscope between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings.
The Blue Rhino dilator was removed leaving the guiding catheter and guide wire assembly in place, all under direct visualization bronchoscopically.
Finally, a Shiley 8.0 cuffed tracheostomy tube with appropriate dilator was introduced over the guiding catheter into the trachea under direct visualization. The dilator, guiding catheter, and J-wire were removed and the tracheostomy tube left in place. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically with the tip approximately 3cm above the carina.
The endotracheal tube was removed and the ventilator connected to the tracheostomy tube. End-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed appropriate ventilation. Surgicel was placed preemptively around the tracheostomy site to reduce bleeding. A Lyofoam drain sponge was placed under the tracheostomy tube prior to suturing into place with 2-0 nylon sutures.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications. The staff physician, Dr. Taylor, was present throughout the entire procedure.
SPECIMEN(S): None
IMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Wilson underwent successful percutaneous tracheostomy with bronchoscopic guidance. Procedure performed without complications. CXR post-procedure shows appropriate positioning without pneumothorax. Continue mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. Tracheostomy care per protocol. Follow up with ICU team for ongoing management.

PFTs show restrictive pattern with DLCO 45% predicted. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to whole lung lavage were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same
PROCEDURE: Whole Lung Lavage (CPT 32997)
ATTENDING: Dr. Richard Brown
ASSISTANT: Dr. Amy Zhang, Fellow
Support Staff:

RN: Daniel Martinez
RT: Sarah Johnson
Anesthesia: Dr. Kevin Park

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with TIVA
MONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring with arterial line
INSTRUMENT: 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube (Broncho-Cath), Olympus bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT POSITION: Initially supine for intubation, then right lateral decubitus
The patient was induced and intubated with a 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty by anesthesia staff. The flexible bronchoscope was advanced into the tracheal portion of the tube to confirm adequate positioning. Tube was adjusted to ensure that the tracheal orifice aligned with the right mainstem bronchus. The bronchial lumen could be seen passing into the left mainstem bronchus; positioning was also confirmed with direct bronchoscopic visualization through the bronchial lumen.
The bronchial balloon was inflated with 8mL of air and tested for leak. Once an adequate seal was made, the patient was positioned in the right lateral decubitus position and the position of the DLT was reconfirmed with bronchoscopy. A repeat leak test was performed and adequate seal was noted.
Lavage Procedure:
The patient was transitioned to single lung ventilation via the right lung. The left lumen of the DLT was connected to the lavage circuit with 3L bags of warmed (37°C) 0.9% normal saline.
Serial aliquots of saline were instilled in approximately 1 liter increments:

Aliquot 1: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained by gravity. Return: 900mL, very turbid with thick white sediment
Aliquot 2: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 950mL, turbid with white sediment
Aliquot 3: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 980mL, moderately turbid
Aliquot 4: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 990mL, mildly turbid
Aliquot 5: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, slightly turbid
Aliquot 6: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, clear

Total volume instilled: 6000mL
Total volume returned: 5820mL
Net balance: -180mL (absorbed)
The effluent became progressively clearer. Lavage was discontinued when return fluid was nearly clear. Throughout the procedure, oxygen saturation remained >94% on the ventilated right lung. End-tidal CO2 remained stable at 38-42 mmHg.
After completion of lavage, gentle suctioning was performed through the left bronchial lumen. Bilateral lung ventilation was resumed. DLT position was reconfirmed. The patient was transported to PACU intubated for extubation after full recovery from anesthesia.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Brown, was present throughout the entire procedure.
SPECIMEN(S):

Lavage fluid (first aliquot) sent for cell count, cytology, and periodic acid-Schiff staining

IMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Rodriguez underwent successful whole lung lavage of the left lung for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Procedure completed without complications. Patient will undergo right lung lavage in 4-6 weeks pending clinical response. Post-procedure CXR shows expected mild bilateral infiltrates, no pneumothorax. Plan for 6-minute walk test and PFTs in 4 weeks to assess response. GM-CSF therapy to be discussed with pulmonology.

RT: David Lee

ANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia with Lidocaine 1%
MONITORING: Pulse oximetry, blood pressure
INSTRUMENT: CareFusion PleurX catheter system, ultrasound machine
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT POSITION: Sitting upright at 60 degrees, right arm elevated
CHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: (Image saved and printed)

Hemithorax: Right
Pleural Effusion Volume: Large
Echogenicity: Anechoic
Loculations: None
Diaphragmatic Motion: Diminished
Lung sliding before procedure: Present
Lung consolidation/atelectasis: Present (compressive atelectasis)
Pleura: Mildly thickened, no nodularity visualized

The right lateral chest was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Ultrasound guidance was used to identify the optimal insertion site and confirm absence of vital structures.
ANESTHESIA: Lidocaine 1%: 20ml injected at skin, subcutaneous tissue, pleura, and tunnel tract
Entry Site: Right 5th Intercostal Space
Location: Mid-axillary line
Procedure Steps:

A finder needle (18G) was used to enter the pleural space in the 5th intercostal space along the midaxillary line under ultrasound guidance. Pleural fluid was easily aspirated (straw-colored fluid). The needle was withdrawn and a 0.038" guidewire was placed into the pleural space through the finder catheter.
Two 5mm skin incisions were made: one at the guidewire entry site and another 5-6cm away anteriorly for the catheter exit site.
The tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue from the exit site to the pleural entry site. Tunnel length: 6cm.
Serial dilation over the guidewire was achieved using 10Fr and 15Fr dilators. The peel-away introducer sheath (16Fr) was placed over the guidewire and advanced into the pleural space.
The guidewire was removed. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the introducer sheath into the pleural space until all fenestrations were within the pleural cavity (approximately 15cm inserted).
The introducer sheath was peeled away and removed. The pleural entry site incision was closed with a 3-0 absorbable suture (Vicryl).
The catheter cuff was positioned in the subcutaneous tunnel approximately 1cm from the exit site. The catheter was secured to the skin at the exit site using 2-0 nylon sutures.
Sterile dressings were applied (foam and transparent dressing).

Exit site: 5th Intercostal space, anterior axillary line
Initial Drainage:
The PleurX vacuum bottle was attached and drainage initiated.

Fluid Removed: 1200 mL
Appearance: Serous, straw-colored

Pleural Pressures Measured:

Opening: -8 cmH₂O
500ml: -10 cmH₂O
1000ml: -15 cmH₂O
1200ml: -18 cmH₂O (stopped due to chest discomfort)

Drainage device: Initially vacuum bottle, then capped after drainage complete
SPECIMEN(S):

Pleural fluid (cytology, chemistry, cell count)

Post-procedure ultrasound showed reduced effusion volume with no pneumothorax. Post-procedure CXR ordered.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with only mild discomfort during catheter insertion. The attending, Dr. Green, was present throughout the entire procedure.
IMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Johnson underwent successful placement of right-sided tunneled pleural catheter for recurrent malignant effusion. Procedure completed without complications. Patient and family educated on catheter care and home drainage protocol. Drainage every other day initially, adjusting based on output. Follow-up appointment in 2 weeks. Home health nursing arranged for first drainage. Patient given written discharge instructions and emergency contact information.

Patient: Harold Stevens | Age: 66 | Sex: M | MRN: 1256170
Date: October 8, 2024
Attending: Dr. Nicole Turner
Clinical Summary: Patient is a 66 year old gentleman presenting with a large right sided pleural effusion, unclear etiology. Previous thoracentesis showed exudative fluid with negative cytology. CT shows pleural thickening concerning for malignancy versus infectious process.
We discussed the need for tissue diagnosis via medical thoracoscopy. Risks including bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, and rare complications such as empyema or need for surgical intervention were explained. The patient understood and signed consent.
Procedure Performed: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, chest tube placement
How it went: Patient was positioned in left lateral decubitus. Right hemithorax prepped and draped. Ultrasound used to mark the 5th intercostal space at mid-axillary line - this showed large effusion with no loculations. After infiltrating with 20cc of 1% lidocaine, we made a 2cm incision and used blunt dissection to enter the pleural space. Initial gush of fluid noted. A 28Fr chest tube was inserted and connected to suction, draining approximately 800mL of bloody fluid initially.
Through the same incision site, we introduced the rigid thoracoscope. The pleural space was systematically examined. Findings were significant: The parietal pleura showed multiple white nodular lesions, largest about 1.5cm, scattered throughout. The visceral pleura had similar appearing nodules with some areas of thickened pleura. Lung appeared trapped with inability to fully expand. There were some loose adhesions which were lysed using blunt technique.
Multiple biopsies were taken from both parietal and visceral pleura using biopsy forceps - total of 8 samples obtained from various sites. Each biopsy site had minimal bleeding controlled with pressure.
After biopsies were complete, we decided to proceed with talc pleurodesis given the likely malignant etiology and trapped lung. Approximately 4 grams of sterile talc slurry mixed in 50mL normal saline was insufflated throughout the pleural cavity ensuring good distribution. The chest tube was left in place and secured with 0-silk suture. Dressing applied.
Pathology sent: Pleural biopsies x8 in formalin, pleural fluid for cytology and chemistry
Patient did well throughout. No complications. Transferred to floor with chest tube to suction at -20cmH2O. Post procedure CXR pending.
Follow up plan: Monitor drainage. Chest tube likely to stay for several days given trapped lung. Await pathology. If malignancy confirmed, will need oncology consultation. Patient understands may need indwelling pleural catheter if lung doesn't re-expand.

If drainage <150mL over next 24 hours AND CXR shows no reaccumulation, consider chest tube removal in 48-72 hours

ASSESSMENT: Chemical pleurodesis with talc slurry via chest tube completed successfully without complications. Patient tolerated procedure reasonably well with adequate pain control. Will monitor for pleurodesis efficacy over next several days.
Follow-up Plan:

Daily CXR while chest tube in place
Remove chest tube when drainage criteria met (typically 2-3 days)
Follow-up CXR 1 week after chest tube removal
If recurrent effusion develops, may consider PleurX catheter placement

She has been experiencing progressive dyspnea over the past 3 months and was found to have:

Right mainstem bronchus obstruction - Interval CT imaging from 10/10/2024 shows tumor recurrence causing 85% obstruction of the right mainstem bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonitis of the entire right lung
Malignant pericardial effusion - Echo from 10/15/2024 showed moderate-large pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology (RA collapse)
Right malignant pleural effusion - Thoracentesis 10/18/2024 confirmed malignant cells

The patient presented to our interventional pulmonology clinic 10/20/2024 with severe dyspnea (MMRC grade 4), inability to lie flat, oxygen requirement of 4L NC at rest. Given the multiple sites requiring intervention and the patient's overall debilitated status, the decision was made to address all issues in a single procedure session to minimize anesthetic exposures.
MULTIDISCIPLINARY PLANNING
Pre-procedure conference held 10/23/2024 with IP, cardiothoracic surgery, oncology, and anesthesia. Plan formulated:

Address airway obstruction first (most critical)
Follow with pericardial window creation
Complete with PleurX catheter placement if patient tolerates

INFORMED CONSENT
Extensive discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy) on 10/24/2024 at 16:00. Risks discussed in detail:

Bleeding (estimated 5-10% risk given tumor vascularity)
Perforation or pneumothorax (5% risk)
Arrhythmia during pericardial procedure (10-15%)
Hypoxemia or respiratory failure (moderate risk given baseline status)
Need for ICU care postoperatively (expected)
Mortality risk (~2-5% given complexity and comorbidities)

Benefits reviewed: Improved breathing, reduced cardiac compromise, palliation of symptoms.
Alternatives discussed: No intervention (continued clinical decline), staged procedures (multiple anesthetic exposures).
Patient and daughter understood risks and expressed wish to proceed. Written consent obtained and witnessed.

OPERATIVE REPORT - DETAILED NARRATIVE
PART 1: AIRWAY INTERVENTION (07:45 - 10:15)
Patient brought to hybrid OR suite. After successful induction of general anesthesia, formal time-out performed with all team members present. Confirmed:

Correct patient (ID band, verbal confirmation)
Procedures planned (airway intervention, pericardial window, pleural catheter)
Positioning (supine throughout)
Antibiotic prophylaxis (Cefazolin 2g IV given)
Steroid coverage (Dexamethasone 10mg IV given)
Blood products available (2 units PRBCs typed and crossed)

Initial orotracheal intubation performed by anesthesia with video laryngoscopy - 8.0mm ETT placed without difficulty. Position confirmed at 21cm at teeth with end-tidal CO2 and bilateral breath sounds. However, significantly diminished breath sounds on right side noted.
Initial Flexible Bronchoscopy Survey:
Olympus BF-1T180 therapeutic bronchoscope introduced through ETT. Findings:

Supraglottic structures: Normal, no lesions
Vocal cords: Mobile bilaterally, no masses
Subglottis: Normal caliber, no stenosis
Trachea: Patent, mild mucosal erythema, no significant secretions
Carina: Widened, evidence of external compression from adenopathy
Left main bronchus: Patent, some extrinsic compression but adequate luminal diameter
LUL, Lingula, LLL: All segments visualized and patent
Right main bronchus: CRITICAL FINDING - Near-complete obstruction beginning 1cm from carina. Large fungating tumor mass arising from anterior and lateral walls, extending 4cm distally. Approximately 90% obstruction. Friable, hemorrhagic appearance. Unable to pass bronchoscope beyond lesion. No visualization of RUL, RML, or RLL orifices.

Decision: Proceed with rigid bronchoscopy for tumor debridement and airway restoration.
Rigid Bronchoscopy Phase:
Patient re-positioned with shoulder roll for neck extension. The 8.0mm ETT was removed. A Storz 13mm rigid bronchoscope (Model #8580C) was carefully introduced through the oral cavity under direct visualization using Weerda laryngoscope.
Ventilation strategy: High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) via rigid scope side arm. Ventilator settings: Frequency 150/min, Driving pressure 2.0 bar, FiO2 1.0, I:E ratio 1:1.5. Good chest rise and end-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed adequate ventilation.
The rigid scope was advanced through the vocal cords under direct visualization. The trachea was traversed without difficulty. The tumor mass in right mainstem bronchus was encountered.
Mechanical Debridement:
Using the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope as a core, the tumor was mechanically debrided with careful forward pressure and rotating motion. Multiple passes were required. Tumor tissue was extremely friable with significant bleeding encountered.
Estimated tumor volume removed via coring: Approximately 20-25 cubic centimeters of tumor tissue
Hemostasis Measures:
As expected, bleeding was brisk during debulking. The following measures were employed:

Iced saline lavage: 500mL total of iced normal saline instilled in 50-100mL aliquots, allowed to dwell 30-60 seconds, then suctioned. This provided temporary hemostasis.
Topical epinephrine: 1:10,000 concentration, total 30mL instilled in divided doses to tumor bed. Significant reduction in bleeding achieved.
Tranexamic acid: 1 gram in 100mL NS instilled topically (in addition to 1g IV given by anesthesia systemically). Further improvement in hemostasis.

After approximately 30 minutes of mechanical debridement and hemostatic measures, adequate visualization of distal airways was achieved. The RUL, RML, and RLL orifices could be visualized, though tumor bulk remained on the airway walls.
Electrocautery:
Flexible bronchoscope (Olympus) passed through rigid barrel. Electrocautery probe advanced through working channel. Residual tumor tissue was cauterized using monopolar cautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. FiO2 was reduced to 0.4 during cautery per safety protocol.
Treatment areas: Anterior wall, lateral wall, and carina region of right mainstem bronchus
Treatment time: Approximately 8 minutes total cautery time
Effect: Tumor base cauterized, some reduction in tumor bulk, improved hemostasis
Argon Plasma Coagulation:
APC probe (ERBE VIO system) advanced through flexible scope. Settings: 40 watts, Argon flow 1.5 L/min, Pulsed mode.
Treatment: Circumferential APC application to all visible tumor tissue in right mainstem bronchus. Particular attention to areas of residual bleeding.
Duration: 6 minutes active APC time
Result: Excellent hemostasis achieved, visible coagulation effect on tumor surface
Assessment after debridement:
Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 50% patent (improved from <10% pre-treatment). However, significant residual tumor bulk and malacia noted.
Balloon Dilation:
Boston Scientific CRE balloon catheter (12mm x 4cm) advanced over guidewire to stenotic segment under fluoroscopic guidance.
Inflation sequence:

First inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds
Second inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds
Third inflation: 14mm diameter x 90 seconds (maximum size)

Fluoroscopy showed excellent balloon expansion across entire stenotic segment. Upon deflation, improved luminal diameter appreciated.
Post-dilation assessment: Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 60-65% patent. However, given residual tumor bulk, malacia, and risk of rapid re-obstruction, decision made to place stent.
Stent Placement:
After discussion with anesthesia regarding patient stability (patient remained stable throughout), proceeded with metallic stent placement.
Stent selected: Boston Scientific Ultraflex covered metallic stent, 14mm diameter x 60mm length
Deployment technique:

Stent advanced over guidewire under combined bronchoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance
Positioned to span from 0.5cm distal to carina to mid-right mainstem bronchus
Fluoroscopic confirmation of position in AP and lateral views
Slow, controlled deployment under direct visualization
Post-deployment balloon dilation of stent (12mm balloon) to ensure full stent expansion

Post-stent assessment:
Flexible bronchoscope passed through rigid scope and into stent lumen.
Findings:

Stent well-positioned, no migration
Excellent apposition to airway walls
RUL orifice: Fully visible through stent side mesh, patent
RML orifice: Visible and patent
RLL orifice: Visible and patent
All segments of right lung now visualized for first time
Significant amount of retained secretions in distal airways (expected due to chronic obstruction)

Therapeutic Aspiration:
Extensive suctioning and aspiration performed in all segments of right lung. Thick, purulent-appearing secretions removed from:

Right upper lobe: Approximately 30mL
Right middle lobe: Approximately 20mL
Right lower lobe: Approximately 40mL

Total secretions removed: ~90mL. Samples sent for culture.
Final Airway Inspection:

Trachea: Normal
Left bronchial tree: Unchanged, patent
Right main stem: Patent through stent, estimated 85-90% luminal patency (compared to pre-procedure ~10%)
RUL, RML, RLL: All now patent with significant improvement in ventilation
Minimal residual bleeding, hemostasis excellent

Rigid bronchoscope removed. Patient re-intubated with 8.0mm ETT. Confirmation of ETT position with bronchoscopy and capnography. Bilateral breath sounds now audible (marked improvement in right-sided ventilation compared to pre-procedure).
Airway Intervention Completed: 10:15 AM
Estimated blood loss during airway phase: 200mL
Specimens obtained: Tumor tissue (pathology), secretions (microbiology)

PART 2: PERICARDIAL WINDOW (10:30 - 11:15)
Patient repositioned with arms tucked. Subxiphoid area prepped and draped in sterile fashion by cardiothoracic surgery team. Interventional pulmonology team assisted.
TEE probe inserted by anesthesia showed moderate-large circumferential pericardial effusion with RV diastolic collapse.
Surgical technique (performed by CT surgery, Dr. Harrison):

Subxiphoid incision, approximately 4cm
Dissection carried down to pericardium
Pericardium opened, approximately 4cm x 3cm window created
Rush of 400mL of serosanguineous fluid
Pericardial biopsy obtained (sent for pathology and cytology)
No active bleeding from pericardial surface
19Fr Blake drain left in pericardial space
Drain secured to skin, connected to bulb suction

TEE post-drainage: Complete resolution of pericardial effusion, no RV collapse, improved cardiac output.

PART 3: PLEURAL CATHETER PLACEMENT (11:20 - 11:45)
With patient still under general anesthesia, attention turned to right pleural effusion.
Ultrasound examination (performed by IP team):

Right hemithorax with moderate-large pleural effusion
Estimated volume: 1000-1200mL
Anechoic fluid, no loculations
Compressed right lung (though now ventilating via stent)

PleurX catheter placement:
Standard tunneled technique as previously described. Entry site: 6th intercostal space, mid-axillary line. Exit site: 5cm anterior. Catheter advanced 15cm into pleural space.
Initial drainage: 850mL of serosanguineous fluid removed (stopped at patient request earlier - she was waking up and uncomfortable).
Chest tube secured with 2-0 nylon sutures. Occlusive dressing applied.

PROCEDURE CONCLUSION
All procedures completed successfully. Total operative time: 4 hours 15 minutes.
Patient Status at Conclusion:

Remove pericardial drain when output <50mL/day
Transition to floor when stable
Continue PleurX catheter drainage
Pain control
Physical therapy for reconditioning

Medium-term (1-2 weeks):

Discharge with home health for PleurX catheter management
Follow-up in IP clinic at 2 weeks with chest X-ray
Discuss with oncology regarding re-initiation of systemic therapy now that dyspnea improved

Long-term:

Surveillance bronchoscopy at 6-8 weeks to assess stent
Monitor for stent-related complications (migration, granulation, tumor in-growth)
May need stent revision/exchange
PleurX catheter to remain until auto-pleurodesis occurs or end of life


ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
Mrs. Okafor presented with critical, multi-system involvement of metastatic lung cancer causing:

Near-complete right mainstem bronchus obstruction → Successfully addressed with tumor debridement and stent
Cardiac tamponade physiology → Successfully addressed with pericardial window
Large pleural effusion → Successfully palliated with PleurX catheter

All procedures were technically successful without intra-operative complications. The patient now has:

Restored right lung ventilation (dramatic improvement from pre-procedure state)
Resolution of cardiac compromise
Control of pleural effusion

Prognosis: Given stage IV disease, prognosis remains guarded with likely survival measured in months. However, these palliative interventions should significantly improve quality of life by reducing dyspnea and allowing potential resumption of systemic therapy.
The patient and family understand this is palliative care aimed at symptom control rather than cure. They expressed gratitude for the interventions and understanding of the goals of care.

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN STATEMENT
I, David Kim, MD, was present and actively participating throughout the entire procedure. I performed the critical portions of the airway intervention including tumor debridement, cautery, stent placement, and final bronchoscopic assessment. I supervised Dr. Foster throughout the pleural catheter placement. I assisted the cardiothoracic surgery team during pericardial window creation.
The procedure was medically necessary, technically indicated, and appropriately performed. Informed consent was obtained. The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate complications.
