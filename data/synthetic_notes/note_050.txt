PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration
OPERATOR: Nguyen, Thai MD (Attending) ASSISTANT: Rodriguez, Carlos MD (IP Fellow) NURSING: Susan Miller RN, BSN RESPIRATORY THERAPY: John Davis RRT
CLINICAL INDICATION: Patient is a 64-year-old Hispanic female with recently diagnosed left lower lobe adenocarcinoma (biopsy-proven). Presented today for mediastinal staging via EBUS-TBNA. CT chest shows multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. PET avid nodes at stations 4L, 7, and 10L.
PRE-PROCEDURE:
•	Informed consent: Yes, documented
•	NPO status: >8 hours confirmed
•	ASA class: III (controlled DM, HTN)
•	Anticoagulation held appropriately
•	IV access: 18G right AC
•	Monitoring: SpO2, ETCO2, BP, ECG
MEDICATIONS: Pre-procedure: Glycopyrrolate 0.2mg IV Sedation: Midazolam 3mg IV, Fentanyl 100mcg IV Topical: Lidocaine 4% spray x4, Lidocaine 2% 20mL via scope
PROCEDURE DETAILS:
Time in room: 1015 Procedure start: 1025
Procedure end: 1108 Total time: 43 minutes
EBUS bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC180F) introduced via oral route after adequate sedation and topical anesthesia. Systematic survey of mediastinum performed.
LYMPH NODE ULTRASOUND CHARACTERISTICS:
Station 2R: 8mm, normal hilum, not sampled Station 2L: Not well visualized Station 4R: 16mm, oval, preserved architecture
Station 4L: 34mm x 19mm, ROUND, HYPOECHOIC, loss of hilum - ABNORMAL Station 7: 39mm x 24mm, ENLARGED, heterogeneous, irregular margins - ABNORMAL Station 10L: 26mm x 16mm, hypoechoic, loss of hilum - ABNORMAL Station 10R: 11mm, normal Station 11L: 23mm x 14mm, abnormal echotexture - ABNORMAL
TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION PERFORMED:
Station 7 (Subcarinal) - 39 x 24mm
•	Elastography: Blue (firm)
•	Pass 1: 22G needle, 25 excursions with suction → Good sample
•	Pass 2: Repeat for adequacy → ROSE: ADEQUATE, MALIGNANT CELLS +
•	Pass 3: Cell block preparation → ROSE: Confirms malignancy
•	Pass 4: Additional for molecular markers
•	Complications: None
Station 4L - 34 x 19mm
•	Pass 1-3: 22G needle → ROSE: POSITIVE for malignant cells, consistent with adenocarcinoma
Station 10L - 26 x 16mm
•	Pass 1-2: 22G needle → ROSE: Malignant cells identified
Station 11L - 23 x 14mm
•	Pass 1-2: 22G needle → ROSE: Atypical cells, favor malignant
Airways inspected: No endobronchial lesions. RUL, RML, RLL, LUL, Lingula, LLL all patent.
Hemostasis: Adequate throughout. No significant bleeding.
RAPID ON-SITE EVALUATION (Dr. Peterson, Cytopathology):
•	Station 7: POSITIVE for malignancy
•	Station 4L: POSITIVE for malignancy
•	Station 10L: POSITIVE for malignancy
•	Station 11L: Atypical cells, favor malignant
SPECIMENS SENT: ✓ Cytology (all stations) ✓ Cell block (Station 7) ✓ Molecular testing - EGFR, ALK, ROS1, PD-L1 (Station 7) ✓ Microbiology - AFB, fungal cultures (Station 7)
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <5mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
PATIENT TOLERANCE: Excellent, hemodynamically stable throughout, no desaturations
POST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:
•	Recovery observation x2 hours
•	NPO x1 hour then advance diet
•	Vital signs q15min x4, then q30min x2
•	Call physician for: chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, fever
DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: Successful EBUS-TBNA demonstrating N3 disease (stations 7, 4L, 10L, 11L all positive for malignancy). Stage IIIB disease confirmed.
TREATMENT PLAN:
6.	Oncology consultation - already scheduled
7.	Tumor board presentation
8.	Final pathology and molecular markers pending (3-5 days)
9.	Patient counseled regarding findings and staging implications
10.	Follow-up in IP clinic 2 weeks
