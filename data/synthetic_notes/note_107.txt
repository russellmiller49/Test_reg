NAME: PATRICIA ANDERSON / ID#: MR-K8374 / D.O.B: 02/17/1957

INDICATION: RUL endobronchial lesion causing post-obstructive pneumonia + mediastinal LAD

ANESTHESIA: General via ETT, maintained on sevoflurane + fentanyl, Ramsay 6
Arterial line placed, continuous BP/SpO2/ETCO2 monitoring

PART A - STAGING EBUS:
Systematic evaluation N3→N2→N1
- 2R (8mm): 3 passes, ROSE negative for malignancy
- 4R (13mm): 4 passes, ROSE positive malignant, PET+, molecular sent
- 7 (9mm): 3 passes, ROSE negative
- 10R (7mm): 3 passes, ROSE adequate

PART B - TUMOR BIOPSY:
RUL endobronchial mass causing 70% luminal narrowing
Multiple forceps biopsies obtained ×6
Brush cytology ×2
Moderate bleeding controlled with epi 1:20,000 + iced saline

COMPLICATIONS: Transient hypoxia to 88% during tumor manipulation, resolved with increased FiO2 and suctioning. Moderate bleeding as noted, controlled intraprocedurally.

PLAN: Awaiting path for treatment planning. May need repeat bronch for stent if airway compromise worsens.
