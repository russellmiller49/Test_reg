**Post-operative Diagnosis:** Pending final pathology

**Procedures Performed:**
- Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (superDimension)
- Radial endobronchial ultrasound
- Transbronchial biopsy
- Fiducial marker placement

**CPT Codes:** 31627, 31654, 31628, 31626

**Clinical Summary:**
66-year-old female with 40 pack-year smoking history. Screening LDCT revealed RUL nodule with spiculated margins. PET scan SUV 6.8. No mediastinal adenopathy. Presents for diagnostic evaluation and fiducial placement for potential SBRT.

**Anesthesia:**
Moderate procedural sedation administered by anesthesia team (Dr. James Wilson). Versed 2mg, Fentanyl 75mcg, Propofol infusion titrated to effect. Total propofol 180mg. Patient maintained spontaneous respirations. O2 via nasal cannula 4L.

**Monitoring:**
Continuous pulse oximetry, telemetry, NIBP q3min. Independent observer (RN Kelly Martinez) dedicated to monitoring. No adverse events.

**Procedure Narrative:**

Following adequate sedation, Olympus therapeutic bronchoscope inserted transorally. Complete airway inspection:

Oropharynx/Larynx: WNL, good topicalization with 2% lidocaine spray
VC: Mobile bilaterally
Trachea: Midline, no stenosis or masses
Carina: Acute angle, mobile
RMS: Patent
RUL/RML/RLL: All segments visualized, patent, no endobronchial abnormalities
LMS: Patent
LUL/Lingula/LLL: Patent, no lesions

SuperDimension iLogic navigation system used. CT from 11/10/2024 loaded. 3D reconstruction showed target in RUL anterior segment, approximately 3cm from pleural surface.

**Navigation Process:**
Automatic registration completed. 8 reference points confirmed. System accuracy indicator: 95%.

Locatable guide (LG) with extended working channel navigated to target. Multiple airway bifurcations traversed under electromagnetic guidance. Final position: tool-to-target distance 7mm (acceptable range per software).

Radial EBUS probe (20MHz) inserted through working channel:
- Pattern: Concentric
- Lesion characteristics: Hypoechoic, irregular borders
- Size: 28mm x 31mm
- Echo features suggest solid lesion

Probe removed, guide sheath maintained in position.

**Sampling via guide sheath:**
1. Transbronchial forceps biopsies - 8 passes (specimens appeared adequate grossly, tan-white tissue fragments)
2. Cytology brush - 4 passes
3. Needle aspiration - 2 passes with 19G needle
4. BAL - 60cc instilled, 28cc return

**ROSE Results:**
Cytopathologist Dr. Susan Park present. Smears reviewed real-time.
Pass 1-3: Inadequate (mostly blood)
Pass 4-8: ADEQUATE. Clusters of atypical epithelial cells with enlarged nuclei, prominent nucleoli. Morphology consistent with non-small cell carcinoma, likely adenocarcinoma. Cell block for immunohistochemistry pending.

**Fiducial Placement:**
Given high suspicion for malignancy and potential for SBRT, fiducial marker placed for radiation planning.

Gold marker (0.8mm x 3mm, CIVCO) loaded into delivery catheter. Under fluoroscopic guidance, marker deployed in RUL anterior segmental bronchus, approximately 2cm from target lesion. Position confirmed with AP and lateral fluoroscopy. Marker stable, no migration observed.

**Hemostasis:**
Minimal bleeding from biopsy sites. Resolved with gentle suctioning and observation. No intervention required.

**Completion:**
Airways suctioned clear. Patient emerged from sedation appropriately. Extubated to room air. Post-procedure vitals stable. SpO2 97% RA.

**Estimated Blood Loss:** <15mL

**Specimens:**
- TBBx x8 to histopathology (formalin)
- Cytology specimens x4 (alcohol fixed)
- Needle aspirate x2 (cell block)
- BAL to microbiology (AFB, fungal, bacterial cx) and cytology

**Complications:** None

**Post-Procedure Orders:**
1. CXR PA/Lateral in 2 hours - r/o PTX
2. Monitoring in recovery x 2 hours minimum
3. Discharge home if CXR clear and vitals stable
4. Return precautions reviewed with patient

**Assessment:** Successful EMN bronchoscopy with probable diagnosis of NSCLC based on ROSE. Fiducial placed for radiation planning.

**Plan:**
- Await final pathology with molecular markers (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, PD-L1)
- Complete staging with brain MRI
- Tumor board discussion for treatment planning (surgical candidate vs SBRT vs systemic therapy)
- Follow-up appointment scheduled 1 week

2. Right upper lobe carina
3. Bronchus intermedius
4. RML orifice
5. RML bifurcation (medial/lateral)
6. Lateral segmental bifurcations (x2)
7. Subsegmental anatomy

Registration accuracy: Estimated <5mm deviation (acceptable per protocol)
Time to complete registration: 11 minutes

**Navigation Phase:**
Locatable guide (LG) with extended working channel (EWC) advanced along planned pathway.

Progress checkpoints:

Findings:
- Initial scan: eccentric pattern (lesion adjacent to probe, not centered)
- Repositioned LG 4mm anterior
- Repeat scan: concentric pattern achieved
- Lesion diameter: 18mm
- Ultrasound characteristics: Mixed echogenicity (central hyperechoic area with hypoechoic periphery consistent with part-solid nature on CT)
