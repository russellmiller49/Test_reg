Name: George Martinez / MRN: ZZ-4829-Q / Birth: 07/19/1956

INDICATION: Mediastinal staging, RUL NSCLC

Sedation: Moderate (midazolam/fentanyl), Ramsay 3, monitoring q5min

EBUS-TBNA performed with systematic approach (N3→N2→N1):

Station 4R (11mm, PET+):
- Pass 1: ROSE - insufficient cellularity
- Pass 2: ROSE - insufficient cellularity
- Pass 3: ROSE - insufficient cellularity
- Pass 4: ROSE - finally adequate, benign lymphocytes seen
- Pass 5: ROSE - adequate
→ 5 total passes needed for adequacy

Station 7 (15mm, PET+):
- Passes 1-3: ROSE adequate immediately, positive for malignancy

Station 11R (7mm, PET-):
- Passes 1-3: ROSE adequate

ALL NODES ADEQUATE: Yes (eventually, though station 4R required extra passes)
MOLECULAR SUCCESS: Yes, tissue sent from station 7

Systematic sequence used: Yes
Photodocumentation completed: Yes

No complications.

Impression: N2 disease confirmed (station 7). Station 4R benign despite PET avidity. Adequate tissue for molecular testing obtained.
