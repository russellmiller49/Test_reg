**OPERATIVE REPORT - ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY**

DATE: 02/08/2025
PATIENT: Rodriguez, Antonio M., 64M
MRN: 7736291
SURGEONS: Dr. Melissa Anderson (Attending), Dr. Kevin Nguyen (Fellow)
ANESTHESIA: Dr. Patricia Sullivan

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, largest RLL 2.6cm, ddx includes metastatic disease vs primary lung cancer vs infection

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Pending pathology

PROCEDURES:
1. Ion robotic navigational bronchoscopy
2. Radial EBUS
3. Transbronchial biopsies
4. Bronchoalveolar lavage

INDICATION: 64M with remote history of colon cancer (stage II, 2010) now with multiple lung nodules. Largest nodule RLL posterior segment 2.6cm, PET SUV 5.1. Other nodules range 0.8-1.4cm bilaterally. Biopsy needed for diagnosis.

CONSENT: Standard procedural risks discussed including but not limited to pneumothorax, bleeding, infection, respiratory failure, need for mechanical ventilation, chest tube placement. Questions answered. Written consent obtained.

ANESTHESIA DETAILS:
Patient brought to OR, monitored anesthesia care established. General anesthesia induced with propofol, fentanyl, rocuronium. Intubation with 8.0 ETT placed at 22cm, confirmed with ETCO2 and auscultation.

Ventilation: Pressure control mode, Pinsp 18, RR 14, PEEP 5, FiO2 55%, Pmean 13

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:

Time-out performed confirming patient identity, procedure, and site. All imaging reviewed.

CT chest with contrast from 01/25/2025 imported to Intuitive Ion planning system. Three-dimensional airway reconstruction performed. Navigation plan created to RLL posterior segment nodule (largest/most FDG-avid lesion).

Ion bronchoscope inserted through ETT. Initial airway survey:
- Vocal cords: not visualized (via ETT)
- Trachea: patent, mild anterior bowing, no stenosis
- Carina: sharp, mobile
- Right mainstem: patent
- Left mainstem: patent, no endobronchial lesions

Automatic registration initiated. Adequate landmark correlation achieved. Fiducial error: 1.5mm. Confidence sweep performed - stable alignment throughout planned trajectory.

Ion catheter advanced to RLL posterior segment under navigational guidance. Real-time position tracking showed tool-to-target distance of 0.6cm.

Radial EBUS (20MHz probe) inserted through Ion extended working channel. Probe advanced to target showing concentric echogenic pattern with heterogeneous internal echo. Lesion measured 24mm in largest dimension.

Cone-beam CT acquired for trajectory verification. Fusion overlay (NaviLink) confirmed catheter tip within lesion borders, 4mm from center.

SAMPLING PERFORMED:
- Transbronchial forceps biopsies x 7 (formalin for histology)
- Cytology brushings x 3 (ThinPrep)
- BAL from RLL posterior segment: 100cc instilled, 45cc return (sent for cell count, bacterial/fungal/AFB cultures, cytology)

ROSE: Preliminary cytology shows atypical cells, cannot exclude malignancy. Final pathology pending.

Hemostasis confirmed with direct visualization. No active bleeding. Airways suctioned clear.

FINDINGS SUMMARY:
- RLL posterior segment nodule successfully localized and sampled
- No endobronchial lesions
- No significant bleeding

Patient tolerated procedure well. Extubated in OR without difficulty. Transferred to PACU in stable condition, oxygen saturation 98% on 2L NC.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10mL

SPECIMENS: As listed above

COMPLICATIONS: None

POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:
1. Routine post-bronchoscopy monitoring
2. Chest X-ray in 2 hours to r/o pneumothorax
3. Discharge home same day if CXR negative and stable
4. Follow-up IP clinic 2 weeks for pathology results
5. If additional nodules need sampling after final path review, will schedule staged procedure

Procedure supervised and performed by Dr. Melissa Anderson, Attending Physician.
