MULTIFACETED CASE: Bulky mediastinal disease + RML stenosis + LUL peripheral nodule

GENERAL ANESTHESIA: ETT, propofol/remi infusion, Ramsay 6
A-line monitoring, BP continuous

PHASE 1 - STAGING EBUS:
Attempted systematic evaluation - challenging due to bulky disease
- Station 4R: 28mm conglomerate mass, 5 passes, ROSE + malignant, PET+, molecular sent
- Station 7: Unable to access (compressed by tumor)
- Station 10R: 11mm, 3 passes, ROSE + malignant, PET+
- Station 11R: Difficult anatomy, 2 passes obtained, ROSE adequate
Photodoc limited by distorted anatomy

PHASE 2 - ENDOBRONCHIAL DISEASE:
RML bronchus has exophytic tumor causing 80% stenosis
Biopsy ×6 forceps - confirmed same malignancy
Argon plasma coagulation applied for debulking
12mm × 30mm metallic stent placed for symptom relief

PHASE 3 - NAVIGATION FOR LUL NODULE:
EM navigation performed
LUL apical-posterior nodule 16mm targeted
Tool-in-lesion confirmed radial EBUS
Fluoro: 5.2 min, DAP: 201 cGy*cm²
Sampling: needle ×2, biopsy ×3

COMPLICATIONS:
- Moderate bleeding from endobronchial tumor biopsy site (controlled with epi + APC)
- Transient hypoxia to 85% during stent deployment (resolved with ventilator adjustment)

Procedure duration: 98 minutes

Patient recovered well, extubated, ICU observation overnight.
