PATIENT: Michael Chang, 55-year-old Male
MRN: 1145039
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: Mr. Chang is a 55-year-old male with a 1.8cm spiculated left lower lobe nodule discovered on low-dose CT screening. PET shows SUV 3.2. Nodule location is peripheral in the lateral basal segment. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to robotic navigational bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same
PROCEDURE: Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy using Intuitive Ion System (CPT 31627), Radial EBUS (CPT 31654), Transbronchial Biopsy (CPT 31628), Transbronchial Brushing (CPT 31623)
ATTENDING: Dr. Amanda Roberts
ASSISTANT: Dr. Jason Kim, Fellow
Support Staff:

RN: Laura Martinez
RT: Thomas Wilson
Anesthesia: Dr. Susan Park

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation
MONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring
INSTRUMENT: Intuitive Ion Robotic Platform, radial EBUS probe, biopsy forceps, cytology brush
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After induction of general anesthesia and intubation with 8.0 ETT, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
Ventilation Parameters:

Mode: Volume Control
RR: 12
TV: 500mL
PEEP: 5 cmH₂O
FiO₂: 40%
Flow Rate: 50 L/min
Pmean: 14 cmH₂O

Navigation Planning:
CT Chest scan from 9/28/2024 was placed on the separate planning station (Synapse Lung) to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target nodule in the lateral basal segment of the left lower lobe (LB9). The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform.
Target lesion characteristics:

Location: LLL, lateral basal segment (LB9)
Size: 1.8cm
Distance from pleura: 1.2cm
Bronchus sign: Present

Ion Registration - Complete:
Registration to the pre-procedure CT was completed using automatic methods. Adequate airway landmark matching achieved at:

Main carina
Left main carina
LLL segmental carinas
Tertiary bifurcations in LB9

Mean fiducial error: 3.8mm
Global alignment quality: Excellent
No registration drift observed during the case
A confidence sweep confirmed stable targeting throughout the planned trajectory with virtual-to-live alignment within acceptable parameters.
Navigation:
The Ion catheter was advanced under navigational guidance through the left mainstem bronchus, into the LLL, and subsequently into the LB9 segment. The robotic system provided real-time feedback with shape sensing technology.
Target reached notification appeared when catheter tip was 0.6cm from the planned target center.
Radial EBUS Confirmation:
Radial EBUS probe (1.4mm) was passed through the Ion extended working channel to confirm lesion location. The following features were noted:

Pattern: Concentric
Echogenicity: Heterogeneous
Lesion size by REBUS: 19mm
Distance to pleura: 11mm
Vessel proximity: No large vessels within 5mm

Cone-Beam CT Verification:
Mobile C-arm CBCT spin was performed with the Ion catheter in position. Three-dimensional reconstruction confirmed:

Catheter tip within lesion margins
Distance from lesion center: 4mm
Trajectory angle: Optimal for sampling
No pleural transgression

Sampling:
With confirmed tool-in-lesion position:

Transbronchial Biopsy: Forceps biopsies obtained through Ion extended working channel. Total 6 samples collected with visible tissue in each specimen.
Bronchial Brushings: Cytology brush advanced to lesion site. Total 2 brush samples obtained.
Aspiration: Catheter aspiration performed for cytology.

All samples appeared adequate with visible tissue/cellular material. No ROSE available.
Post-Sampling Inspection:
The Ion catheter was withdrawn. Final bronchoscopic inspection showed:

No active bleeding from biopsy site
Patent LLL airways
No complications identified

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Roberts, was present throughout the entire procedure.
SPECIMEN(S):

LLL nodule forceps biopsies x6 (histology, molecular if malignant)
Bronchial brushings x2 (cytology)
Catheter aspiration (cytology)

IMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Chang underwent successful robotic navigational bronchoscopy with sampling of LLL nodule. Procedure completed without complications. Post-procedure CXR shows no pneumothorax. Patient discharged home same day with instructions to follow up in 1 week for pathology results. If benign, will need CT follow-up in 3-6 months per Fleischner criteria. If malignant, will be discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board for treatment planning.
