PATIENT: Sarah Martinez, 58-year-old Female
MRN: 2458901
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: Ms. Martinez is a 58-year-old female who presents with mediastinal lymphadenopathy discovered on staging CT for newly diagnosed right upper lobe mass. PET-CT shows FDG-avid nodes in stations 4R, 7, and 10R. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to EBUS-TBNA were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Mediastinal lymphadenopathy; Right upper lobe mass
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same
PROCEDURE: EBUS-TBNA (CPT 31652, 31653)
ATTENDING: Dr. James Chen
ASSISTANT: Dr. Emily Rogers, Fellow
Support Staff:

RN: Karen Thompson
RT: Michael Davis

ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation with Midazolam 2mg IV and Fentanyl 100mcg IV
MONITORING: Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT: Olympus BF-UC180F EBUS bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location). All procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
The endobronchial ultrasound-capable bronchoscope was introduced through the oral route. 5 cc of 2% lidocaine was instilled for topical anesthesia. Initial airway inspection revealed normal vocal cords with symmetric movement, normal trachea, and patent bilateral mainstem bronchi without endobronchial lesions.
A systematic EBUS survey was completed. The following lymph node stations were identified and sampled:
Station 4R (Right paratracheal):

Size: 18mm (short axis)
Number of Passes: 4
Echo Features: Heterogeneous, defined borders, round shape
Biopsy Tools: 22-gauge needle
ROSE Results: Adequate cellularity, malignant cells present consistent with adenocarcinoma

Station 7 (Subcarinal):

Size: 22mm (short axis)
Number of Passes: 4
Echo Features: Heterogeneous, irregular borders
Biopsy Tools: 22-gauge needle
ROSE Results: Adequate cellularity, malignant cells present

Station 10R (Right hilar):

Size: 14mm (short axis)
Number of Passes: 3
Echo Features: Hypoechoic, defined borders
Biopsy Tools: 22-gauge needle
ROSE Results: Adequate cellularity, malignant cells present

Overall ROSE Diagnosis: Metastatic adenocarcinoma. Prior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Chen, was present at the bedside and supervised the entire procedure.
SPECIMEN(S):

Station 4R TBNA x4 (cytology)
Station 7 TBNA x4 (cytology)
Station 10R TBNA x3 (cytology)

IMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Martinez is a 58-year-old female with newly diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma. EBUS-TBNA confirms N2 and N3 nodal involvement (Stage IIIB). Results will be discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board. Patient to follow up with medical oncology for treatment planning.
