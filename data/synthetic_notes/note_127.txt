Post-intubation tracheal stenosis
Location: 3cm below cords, circumferential narrowing
Baseline stridor with dyspnea on exertion

PROCEDURE: Flexible bronchoscopy + Balloon dilation (CPT 31630)
SEDATION: Propofol/fentanyl (general anesthesia)
FINDINGS:

Vocal cords: normal mobility
Tracheal stenosis at 3cm below glottis
Pre-dilation: ~40% luminal narrowing, circumferential scar tissue
Length: approximately 1.5cm
No active inflammation or granulation

INTERVENTION:

CRE balloon (8mm x 4cm) advanced to stenosis site
Serial dilations performed:

8mm × 60 seconds
10mm × 60 seconds
12mm × 90 seconds (max size)


Total 3 inflations
Post-dilation patency improved to ~75%
Minimal mucosal tearing, no significant bleeding
Topical epinephrine 1:10,000 applied (5mL)

SPECIMENS: None
COMPLICATIONS: None
DISPOSITION:

Extubated in OR, stable
Dexamethasone 10mg IV given
Admit overnight for monitoring
F/u flexible scope in 4 weeks
May need repeat dilation vs stent if restenosis occurs

PLAN:
