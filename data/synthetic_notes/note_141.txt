Name: Rebecca Martinez
Age/Sex: 68/Female
MRN: 1812736
Date: October 21, 2024
Location: Bedside, ICU Room 437
Attending Physician: Dr. Thomas Anderson
Indication: Recurrent malignant pleural effusion (metastatic ovarian cancer), right-sided, despite optimal drainage via chest tube
Background: Patient has had 28Fr chest tube in place for 5 days. Initial drainage was 1400mL, then decreased to <100mL/day for the past 48 hours. CXR today shows good lung expansion with only minimal residual pleural fluid. No air leak present. Patient is appropriate candidate for pleurodesis.
Consent: Obtained from patient. Risks discussed include chest pain/discomfort, fever, respiratory distress (rare), failure of pleurodesis requiring repeat procedure.
Premedication:

Morphine 4mg IV given 30 minutes prior
Acetaminophen 1000mg PO given 1 hour prior
Ondansetron 4mg IV given for nausea prophylaxis


PROCEDURE STEPS:
Step 1 - Verification (Time: 14:00)

Verified chest tube patency by flushing with 10mL sterile saline
Confirmed no air leak on water seal
Reviewed most recent CXR with radiologist - confirmed adequate lung expansion

Step 2 - Lidocaine Administration (Time: 14:05)

Drew up 20mL of 1% lidocaine (200mg total)
Administered through chest tube slowly over 2 minutes
Clamped tube for 5 minutes to allow lidocaine to distribute
Released clamp, allowed to drain

Step 3 - Talc Slurry Preparation (Time: 14:15)

Prepared sterile talc slurry: 4 grams talc powder in 50mL normal saline
Mixed thoroughly in sterile cup until uniform suspension achieved
Drew up into 60mL catheter tip syringe

Step 4 - Talc Administration (Time: 14:20)

Slowly instilled talc slurry through chest tube over 5 minutes
Followed with 20mL normal saline flush to ensure complete delivery
Immediately clamped chest tube

Step 5 - Position Changes (Time: 14:25 - 15:25)
Patient rotated through positions every 15 minutes to distribute talc:

Position 1 (14:25): Supine - 15 minutes
Position 2 (14:40): Right lateral decubitus - 15 minutes
Position 3 (14:55): Prone (as tolerated) - 10 minutes
Position 4 (15:05): Left lateral decubitus - 15 minutes
Position 5 (15:20): Return to supine - 5 minutes

Total dwell time: 60 minutes
Step 6 - Resumption of Drainage (Time: 15:25)

Released clamp on chest tube
Connected back to suction at -20 cmH2O
Immediate return of approximately 30mL serosanguineous fluid


PATIENT TOLERANCE:
During procedure:

Vital signs stable throughout
Complained of moderate chest discomfort (5/10) during position changes
Received additional morphine 2mg IV at 14:50
No respiratory distress
Oxygen saturation maintained >94% on 2L NC

Post-procedure (2 hours observation):

Chest discomfort decreased to 3/10
No fever (temp 37.2Â°C)
No dyspnea
Chest tube draining serosanguineous fluid, approximately 50mL total since unclamping

SPECIMENS: None
COMPLICATIONS: None
POST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:

Continue chest tube to suction -20 cmH2O
Monitor drainage every 4 hours
Pain control: Morphine 2-4mg IV q4h PRN, acetaminophen 650mg PO q6h scheduled
Chest X-ray in AM
If drainage <150mL over next 24 hours AND CXR shows no reaccumulation, consider chest tube removal in 48-72 hours

ASSESSMENT: Chemical pleurodesis with talc slurry via chest tube completed successfully without complications. Patient tolerated procedure reasonably well with adequate pain control. Will monitor for pleurodesis efficacy over next several days.
Follow-up Plan:

Daily CXR while chest tube in place
Remove chest tube when drainage criteria met (typically 2-3 days)
Follow-up CXR 1 week after chest tube removal
If recurrent effusion develops, may consider PleurX catheter placement
