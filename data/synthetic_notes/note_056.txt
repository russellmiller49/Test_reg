Name: Rodriguez, Juan Carlos MR#: 2947385
Age: 59 | Gender: M Date: 03/19/2025
Physician: Dr. Foster, William (Attending)
Procedure: Endobronchial Ultrasound with Needle Aspiration
Why: Lung mass with lymph nodes - need tissue diagnosis
Sedation: Moderate (Versed + Fentanyl)
What we found:
•	Big lymph node under carina (station 7): 36mm
•	Right side lymph node (station 4R): 23mm
•	Left side lymph node (station 4L): 18mm
•	Other smaller nodes at stations 10R (12mm) and 11R (15mm)
What we did: Used ultrasound bronchoscope to look at lymph nodes. Used needle to get samples.
Station 7 - Did 4 needle passes Quick look by pathologist: CANCER CELLS FOUND (adenocarcinoma type)
Station 4R - Did 3 passes Quick look: Also shows cancer
Station 10R - Did 2 passes
Quick look: Normal lymph node
Station 11R - Did 2 passes Quick look: Normal
Bottom line: Cancer spread to lymph nodes in chest (N2 disease)
No problems during procedure. Patient did fine.
What's next:
•	Cancer doctor appointment
•	More scans needed
•	Treatment plan to be made

DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION
2.	Successful EBUS-TBNA with adequate tissue acquisition from multiple mediastinal lymph node stations
3.	ROSE cytology demonstrates NON-NECROTIZING GRANULOMATOUS INFLAMMATION consistent with STAGE II PULMONARY SARCOIDOSIS (bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy)
4.	No evidence of malignancy
5.	Final pathology and culture results pending (5-7 business days)
═══════════════════════════════════════
FOLLOW-UP PLAN
2.	Final pathology review when available (patient portal notification)
3.	Pulmonology clinic follow-up in 2 weeks to review final results and discuss management
4.	Obtain baseline PFTs with DLCO if not recently performed
5.	Consider ophthalmology evaluation (baseline for sarcoid monitoring)
6.	Serum ACE level, calcium level (if not recently checked)
7.	If cultures negative and final pathology confirms sarcoid:
o	Assess for treatment indication based on symptoms
o	If asymptomatic observation vs. treatment decision
o	Prednisone therapy if indicated
8.	Patient educated regarding diagnosis of sarcoidosis, prognosis generally favorable for Stage II disease
9.	Provided written information regarding sarcoidosis
10.	Return precautions reviewed: fever, chest pain, worsening dyspnea, hemoptysis
