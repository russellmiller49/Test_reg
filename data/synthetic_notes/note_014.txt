Chief Indication: RUL mass with mediastinal LAD, diagnostic + staging

HPI: 61F, 35 pack-year smoker (active), presents with 3-month history of cough and right-sided chest discomfort. CT chest shows 3.2cm RUL mass with bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy. PET-CT reveals primary lesion SUV 9.4, multiple N2 stations PET-avid (4R, 7, 2R).

Procedure Performed:
1. EBUS-TBNA for staging
2. Flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy

Anesthesia: Moderate sedation
- Midazolam 3mg IV + Fentanyl 75mcg IV
- Ramsay sedation scale: 3 (responds to commands)
- Monitoring: BP q5min (stable 125-135/72-85), continuous SpO2 (96-99%)

Procedure Details:

EBUS Component:
Systematic mediastinal evaluation following N3→N2→N1 protocol.

Station 2R (12mm):
- 4 passes with 22G needle
- ROSE: Positive for malignant cells
- PET+

Station 4R (18mm):
- 5 passes (extra for molecular)
- ROSE: Positive for malignant cells
- PET+
- Sent for NGS panel

Station 7 (21mm):
- 4 passes
- ROSE: Positive for malignant cells
- PET+

Station 10R (9mm):
- 3 passes
- ROSE: Adequate, benign

Bronchoscopy Component:
Examination of airways revealed mass effect from RUL tumor with partial narrowing of RUL bronchus (~40%). Multiple forceps biopsies obtained from tumor (n=6). Brush cytology x2 also performed.

Moderate bleeding from biopsy sites controlled with topical epinephrine 1:20,000 + iced saline lavage.

Assessment:
- N2/N3 disease confirmed (multi-level, multi-station)
- Primary tumor biopsied
- Adequate tissue for histologic diagnosis and molecular profiling
- Stage IIIB (clinical)

Complications:
- Moderate airway bleeding (controlled, no intervention required beyond topical measures)
- Severity: Moderate

Plan:
- Multidisciplinary tumor board presentation
- Await molecular results (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, PD-L1)
- Likely concurrent chemoradiation vs neoadjuvant approach

Patient Recovery: Stable, discharged after 2 hours
