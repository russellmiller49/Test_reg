This seventy-three year old female patient Catherine Martinez (medical record JJ-8374-Q, born September 8, 1951) presented for electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy targeting a left upper lobe peripheral nodule measuring twenty-three millimeters in greatest dimension on computed tomography. The lesion demonstrated a positive bronchus sign and had a standardized uptake value of five point two on positron emission tomography imaging suggesting malignancy. She underwent moderate conscious sedation with intravenous midazolam three milligrams and fentanyl one hundred micrograms achieving a Ramsay sedation score of three. Her blood pressure was monitored at ten minute intervals throughout and remained stable in the one twenties to one thirties over seventies to eighties. Oxygen saturation was continuously monitored and stayed above ninety-five percent on room air. The electromagnetic navigation system was utilized with successful registration to the preoperative CT scan. The guide sheath was advanced to the left upper lobe apical-posterior segment and the radial endobronchial ultrasound probe confirmed tool-in-lesion position with a concentric echogenic pattern consistent with solid tissue. Total fluoroscopy time was five point one minutes with a dose area product of one hundred ninety-two centigray centimeters squared. Sampling included three needle aspirations using a twenty-one gauge needle, four transbronchial forceps biopsies, and two brush cytology specimens. There was minimal bleeding after the forceps biopsies which resolved spontaneously with gentle suction. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax or significant change from baseline. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home after two hours of observation in stable condition.
