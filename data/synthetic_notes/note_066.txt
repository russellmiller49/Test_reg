===============================================================================
PATIENT: KAREN WHITE | MED REC: PQ-5847 | DOB: 12/30/1962

INDICATION: LLL peripheral nodule 14mm, no clear bronchus sign, PET SUV 2.8 (indeterminate)

ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation protocol
Midazolam 3mg, fentanyl 100mcg
Ramsay 3 achieved, stable throughout
Monitoring: BP q5min, continuous SpO2 >95%

PROCEDURE ATTEMPTED:
Electromagnetic navigation system set up
CT registration performed
Target: LLL anteromedial segment nodule

Navigation attempt:
- Guide sheath advanced to segmental bronchus
- Radial EBUS probe deployed - NO concentric pattern visualized
- Multiple repositioning attempts (×4)
- Fluoroscopy used extensively: 12.4 minutes total fluoro time
- DAP: 389 cGy*cm² (elevated due to multiple attempts)
- Unable to confirm tool-in-lesion despite efforts

Decision: Procedure aborted after 45 minutes due to inability to localize

Sampling performed anyway (blind):
- Forceps biopsies ×3 from suspected area
- Brush cytology ×1

LOCALIZATION SUCCESS: No
TOOL-IN-LESION CONFIRMED: No
SAMPLING PROTOCOL ADHERENT: No (unable to complete full protocol)

Post-procedure: No complications. Small amount of bleeding controlled easily.

PLAN: Discussed with patient - options include CT-guided biopsy vs VATS vs surveillance depending on path results.
