**CONSENT:**
Comprehensive informed consent obtained. Risks discussed including but not limited to: bleeding (1-5%), pneumothorax (1-3%), infection (<1%), mediastinal complications (pericardial/vascular injury <0.1%), need for additional procedures, anesthesia-related complications. Patient expressed understanding and agreed to proceed.

**ANESTHESIA:**
General endotracheal anesthesia administered.
- Induction: Propofol 200mg, Fentanyl 150mcg, Rocuronium 50mg
- Maintenance: Sevoflurane, intermittent propofol boluses
- ETT: 8.0mm at 22cm at teeth
- Ventilation: Pressure control, Pinsp 18, RR 12, PEEP 5, FiO2 50%

**PRE-PROCEDURE TIMEOUT:**
Performed confirming patient identity (verbal + 2 identifiers), procedure planned, site/laterality confirmed, team introductions, equipment availability checked.

**PROCEDURE NARRATIVE:**

**PHASE 1: EBUS-TBNA FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING**

EBUS bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC190F) introduced through ETT.

Systematic mediastinal lymph node survey performed:

**STATION 4R (Right paratracheal):**
- Size: 22mm x 14mm
- Ultrasound features: Hypoechoic, heterogeneous, discrete borders
- Vascular pattern: Central hilar vessels present
- Elastography: Predominantly hard (strain ratio 8.2, suggesting malignancy)
- TBNA: 22-gauge needle, 4 passes
- ROSE: "Abundant cellularity, malignant cells present, consistent with non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma"

**STATION 7 (Subcarinal):**
- Size: 19mm x 16mm
- Ultrasound features: Hypoechoic, round, sharp borders
- Elastography: Firm (strain ratio 6.8)
- TBNA: 22-gauge needle, 4 passes
- ROSE: "Similar malignant cells as 4R, adenocarcinoma"

**Additional Stations Surveyed but Not Sampled:**
- Station 10R: 8mm (below size threshold)
- Station 11R: 6mm (not sampled - diagnostic yield from 4R/7 adequate)
- Left-sided stations: No enlarged nodes identified

**PHASE 2: ION ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR RLL MASS**

After completing EBUS, EBUS scope removed. Ion robotic bronchoscope introduced.

**Navigation Setup:**
CT chest from 11/30/2024 loaded to Ion platform. 3D reconstruction showed target in RLL posterior basal segment.

**Ion Registration:**
Automatic registration performed. Landmarks matched at carina, RLL carina, and segmental bifurcations. Mean fiducial error: 1.3mm (acceptable). No registration drift observed.

**Navigation to Target:**
Ion catheter advanced under navigational guidance to RLL posterior basal segment. Real-time tracking showed tool-to-target distance of 0.7cm at final position.

**Radial EBUS:**
20MHz probe inserted through Ion extended working channel.
- Pattern: Concentric (lesion centered around probe)
- Size: 32mm diameter
- Characteristics: Heterogeneous echogenicity, irregular margins, no visible vessels in immediate vicinity

**CBCT Confirmation:**
Cone-beam CT spin acquired. NaviLink 3D fusion overlay confirmed catheter tip within lesion borders, 4mm from lesion center.

**Sampling of RLL Mass:**
- Transbronchial biopsies: 8 specimens obtained via Ion catheter
- Cytology brushings: 3 specimens
- Bronchial washing: sent for cytology and microbiology

**ROSE (Peripheral Lesion):**
"Adequate samples. Malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma, morphologically similar to lymph node specimens. Recommend molecular testing."

**HEMOSTASIS:**
No significant bleeding from any biopsy sites. Airways clear.

**PROCEDURE COMPLETION:**
Total procedure time: 78 minutes
EBUS portion: 32 minutes
Ion bronchoscopy portion: 46 minutes

Patient tolerated procedure well. Extubated in OR without difficulty. Transferred to PACU in stable condition, SpO2 98% on 2L NC.

**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:** <10mL

**SPECIMENS:**
1. Station 4R TBNA x 4 passes (cell block + cytology)
2. Station 7 TBNA x 4 passes (cell block + cytology)
3. RLL mass TBBx x 8 (formalin, histopathology - **ORDER MOLECULAR TESTING**)
4. RLL mass brushings x 3 (cytology)
5. RLL mass washing (cytology, bacterial/fungal/AFB cultures)

**COMPLICATIONS:** None

**PRELIMINARY FINDINGS:**
- N2 disease confirmed (stations 4R, 7 both positive for adenocarcinoma)
- Primary RLL adenocarcinoma confirmed
- Stage: At least IIIA (T2bN2M0) pending full staging workup

**POST-PROCEDURE PLAN:**
1. Recovery room monitoring per protocol
2. Chest X-ray in 2 hours to rule out pneumothorax
3. Discharge home same day if stable and CXR clear
4. Complete staging: Brain MRI, consider bone scan if not covered by PET
5. Molecular testing: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, PD-L1, broader NGS panel
6. Multidisciplinary tumor board presentation next week
7. Medical oncology referral for neoadjuvant therapy discussion
8. Radiation oncology consultation
9. Follow-up in IP clinic in 1 week with full pathology results

**CLINICAL IMPRESSION:**
Stage IIIA adenocarcinoma of the lung (RLL primary with N2 mediastinal involvement). Not a surgical candidate initially. Will likely require neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy with consideration for surgery after response assessment vs definitive chemoradiation. Molecular profiling pending.

**ATTENDING STATEMENT:**
I was present throughout the entire procedure, personally performed the critical portions including EBUS-TBNA and supervised the Ion navigation and sampling. I reviewed all ROSE results in real-time and made all clinical decisions.
