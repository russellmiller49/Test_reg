Surgeon: Gregory Hamilton, MD
Indications: Tracheal and bronchial stenosis

Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. An I-gel LMA was placed and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal. The subglottic space was normal. Approximately 3 cm below the vocal cords, there was a long segment stenotic lesion which was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern measuring 5 cm in length. The maximal obstruction within the long segment was approximately 60% with an endoluminal diameter of 6-7 mm. There were no simple strictures associated with the stenosis. The carina was sharp.

On the right, there were mucosal changes/erythema without obstruction on the posterior wall of the right mainstem and at the entrance to the right upper lobe. The right upper lobe and mainstem appeared unaffected. The bronchus intermedius was mostly unaffected with small mucosal irregularities. The right middle lobe was minimally narrowed without significant obstruction. There was mild stricturing on the right lower lobe orifice (approximately 10% obstruction). The medial basal segment of the right lower lobe was concentrically obstructed from stricture with only a pinpoint opening (95% occluded). A similar circumferential obstruction was seen at the orifice of the superior segment (80% occluded). The anterior, lateral, and posterior basal segments were partially obstructed from stricture (50%).

On the left, the mainstem was normal. The left upper lobe proper was normal. The lingula was obstructed at the orifice by a similar appearing circumferential obstruction (50% occluded). The superior segment of the left lower lobe was also minimally obstructed from stricture (15% obstructed). The basal segments of the left lower lobe were unaffected.

Following inspection, we then brought our attention to the tracheal stenosis and serial dilatations were performed with 3 cm length with a 12, 13.5, 15 CRE balloon with post-dilatation obstruction of 25% of normal airway. We then inserted the electrocautery knife through the working channel and cuts were made to the band-like strictures within the lingula, the superior segment of the right lower lobe, medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, and anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe. Serial dilatations were performed using the 6, 7, 8 CRE balloon to the lingula, the superior segment of the right lower lobe, medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, and anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe with near complete recanalization of the segments, after which the flexible bronchoscope could easily be passed into the segments. At this point, once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

Recommendations:
• Patient to PACU for recovery
• Patient to follow up with me PRN if symptoms return
