**INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY CONSULT & PROCEDURE NOTE**

REQUESTING SERVICE: Medical Oncology (Dr. Stevens)
PATIENT: Bennett, Sandra L. | 74F | MRN: 3847592
PROCEDURE DATE: 05/07/2025
IP TEAM: Dr. Kevin Murphy (Attending), Dr. Lisa Chang (Fellow)

**CONSULT QUESTION:**
"Patient with known metastatic breast cancer, now with new RLL nodule. Concern for lung metastasis vs new primary. Please evaluate and biopsy if appropriate. Also noted to have enlarged subcarinal node."

**HISTORY:**
74F with PMH of Stage II ER+/HER2- invasive ductal breast carcinoma diagnosed 2017, treated with lumpectomy + radiation + endocrine therapy. Developed bone and liver metastases 2023, currently on palbociclib + letrozole with stable disease.

Recent surveillance CT shows new 2.8cm RLL nodule (not present on prior CT 6 months ago). Also new subcarinal lymphadenopathy 2.1cm. PET/CT: RLL nodule SUV 6.4, subcarinal node SUV 5.9.

Clinical question: Progression of breast cancer to lung vs. new primary lung cancer (would change management significantly).

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Combined EBUS-TBNA + EMN bronchoscopy for tissue diagnosis with appropriate immunohistochemistry to differentiate breast metastasis vs primary lung cancer.

Patient agreeable, scheduled for procedure same day given oncologic urgency.
**PROCEDURE PERFORMED:**

**EBUS-TBNA + EMN Bronchoscopy + Transbronchial Biopsy**

Consent obtained. Anesthesia: MAC (Dr. Roberts). ETT 7.5.

**PHASE 1 - EBUS:**

Surveyed mediastinum systematically.

Station 7 (subcarinal):
- 21 x 18mm, hypoechoic, round
- 22G needle, 5 passes
- ROSE (Dr. Williams): "Positive for malignancy. Adenocarcinoma cells. CK7+/CK20- pattern on rapid IHC. Cannot definitively distinguish breast met vs lung primary on cytology alone - recommend tissue biopsy with full IHC panel."

Other stations surveyed - no other enlarged nodes.

**PHASE 2 - EMN to RLL nodule:**

SuperDimension system. CT from 04/30/25 loaded.
Target: RLL lateral basal segment nodule.

Registration: Auto, 8 points, good accuracy.

Navigated to target - distance 0.7cm per system.

Radial EBUS: Concentric pattern, 26mm heterogeneous lesion.

Sampling:
- TBBx x 8 (formalin - **REQUEST FULL IHC PANEL: TTF-1, Napsin-A, CK7, CK20, ER, PR, HER2, GATA-3, Mammaglobin**)
- Brushings x 3
- BAL

ROSE: "Adenocarcinoma. Morphology could represent either primary lung or breast metastasis. IHC panel will be definitive."

No complications. CXR: no PTX.

**IMPRESSION:**
Adenocarcinoma in both subcarinal node and RLL nodule. Awaiting IHC to determine if breast metastasis vs primary lung cancer.

If breast metastasis → continue systemic breast cancer therapy
If primary lung cancer → separate staging/treatment approach needed

**PLAN:**
- IHC panel expedited (results expected 05/09)
- Contact patient with results
- Tumor board if lung primary confirmed
- Close communication with medical oncology

- Tumor board presentation
- Medical oncology consult
- Thoracic surgery consult
- If EGFR/ALK+ → neoadjuvant targeted therapy consideration

- Radial EBUS
- Transbronchial biopsy
- Endobronchial biopsy (visible tumor in LUL)

**CONSENT:** Obtained. Comprehensive risk discussion including higher bleeding risk given hemoptysis history. Patient understood and agreed.

**ANESTHESIA:**
General with ETT (8.0 at 23cm)
VC mode: TV 500, RR 12, PEEP 5, FiO2 55%, Pmean 13
**PROCEDURE:**

**Part 1: EBUS-TBNA**

EBUS bronchoscope inserted through ETT.

**Mediastinal Survey:**

**Station 4R:** 11mm - appears reactive, not sampled

**Station 4L:**
- 23 x 19mm
- Hypoechoic, heterogeneous, round (loss of oval shape)
- 22G needle, 5 passes
- ROSE (Dr. Martinez): "POSITIVE - Squamous cell carcinoma"

**Station 5 (AP window):**
- 21 x 18mm
- Hypoechoic, irregular borders
- 22G needle, 5 passes
- ROSE: "POSITIVE - Squamous cell carcinoma"

**Station 7:**
- 18 x 16mm

- 22G needle, 4 passes
- ROSE: "POSITIVE - Squamous cell carcinoma"

**Station 10L:**
- 16 x 14mm

- 22G needle, 3 passes
- ROSE: "POSITIVE - Squamous cell carcinoma"

**Nodal Staging Summary:** Extensive disease - N1, N2, and N3 all involved
**Part 2: Standard Airway Survey**

EBUS scope removed. Therapeutic bronchoscope (Olympus BF-1TH190) inserted.

**Finding:** LUL orifice shows exophytic endobronchial tumor - fungating mass with areas of necrosis, nearly occluding lingual ostium.

**Endobronchial Biopsy:**

Given visible endobronchial component, obtained direct biopsies before proceeding to EMN:
- 6 forceps biopsies from endobronchial tumor
- Friable tissue, moderate bleeding
- Managed with epinephrine 1:10,000 5mL + wedging scope
- Hemostasis achieved

ROSE: "Squamous cell carcinoma - consistent with nodal samples"
**Part 3: EMN to Cavitary Component**

Despite endobronchial biopsy being diagnostic, proceeded with EMN to sample cavitary/necrotic component given potential for different biology/infectious etiology.

SuperDimension system. CT from 05/20/2025.

Registration: Automatic, 7 points confirmed.

Target: LUL apical-posterior segment (cavitary portion of mass).

Navigation: Challenging due to tumor distortion of anatomy. Unable to reach planned depth (tumor blocking). Achieved position ~12mm from target per system.

Radial EBUS: Eccentric pattern, visualizing mass edge/cavity wall.

Sampling through guide sheath:
- Forceps biopsies x 5 (from cavity wall)
- Brushings x 2
- BAL x 100cc (sent for bacterial/fungal/AFB cultures + cytology)

ROSE: "Squamous cell carcinoma, areas of necrosis"
**COMPLETION:**

Total time: 64 minutes
Moderate bleeding from endobronchial site - resolved
Patient extubated, stable

**EBL:** ~40mL

**SPECIMENS:**
1. Station 4L TBNA x5
2. Station 5 TBNA x5
3. Station 7 TBNA x4
4. Station 10L TBNA x3
5. LUL endobronchial biopsies x6
6. LUL cavity wall biopsies (EMN) x5
7. LUL brushings x2
8. LUL BAL (cultures + cytology)

**REQUEST PD-L1 testing on tumor specimens**

**COMPLICATIONS:** Moderate endobronchial bleeding - controlled

**POST-OP CXR:** No pneumothorax. Known LUL cavitary mass unchanged.
**FINDINGS:**

**Diagnosis:** Squamous cell carcinoma of LUL with extensive nodal metastases

**Staging:**
- T: T3 (4.3cm with cavitation)
- N: N3 (contralateral mediastinal node station 4L positive)
- M: M0 (pending complete staging)
- **Stage: IIIB (T3N3M0)**

**Characteristics:**
- Cavitary lesion (concerning - DDx includes post-obstructive pneumonia, tumor necrosis)
- Endobronchial extension with near-obstruction
- Extensive nodal disease

**NOT A SURGICAL CANDIDATE** - Stage IIIB with N3 disease
**PLAN:**

**Immediate:**
- Monitor for post-procedure bleeding (patient with prior hemoptysis)
- Continue observation overnight given bleeding during procedure
- F/u CXR in AM

**Staging:**
- Brain MRI
- Complete PET/CT review (ensure no distant mets)

**Infectious Work-up:**
- Culture results pending (bacterial/fungal/AFB from BAL)
- Consider CT-guided drainage if abscess component identified
- Empiric antibiotics if clinical signs of post-obstructive pneumonia

**Oncologic:**
- Medical oncology urgent consult
- Radiation oncology consult
- Definitive concurrent chemoradiation (platinum-doublet + RT)
- PD-L1 results will guide immunotherapy consideration
- Hemoptysis precautions - may need palliative RT if worsens

**Follow-up:**
- IP clinic 1 week
- Earlier if concerning symptoms (increased hemoptysis, fever, dyspnea)

**Prognosis Discussion:**
- Stage IIIB - locally advanced
- Not curable with surgery
- Chemoradiation can provide long-term control in some patients
- Will need frank discussion of prognosis and goals of care
