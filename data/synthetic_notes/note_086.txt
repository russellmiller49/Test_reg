Pt: Christopher Lee
Medical Record Number: KJ-7482-N
Date of Birth: 10/18/1955

COMPLEX INDICATION: Mediastinal lymphadenopathy + LLL peripheral infiltrate (? ILD vs malignancy)

GENERAL ANESTHESIA: ETT, sevoflurane maintenance, Ramsay 6
Continuous monitoring with arterial line

PART 1 - EBUS FOR LYMPH NODES:
Station 4R: 13mm, 3 passes, ROSE shows non-necrotizing granulomas
Station 7: 16mm, 4 passes, ROSE shows similar granulomatous inflammation
Station 11L: 9mm, 3 passes, ROSE adequate

Staging indication: No (diagnostic, not staging)
Systematic sequence: No (targeted approach based on imaging)
All sampled nodes adequate: Yes

PART 2 - TRANSBRONCHIAL CRYOBIOPSY:
LLL peripheral infiltrate sampled with cryoprobe
- Cryobiopsies Ã—4 from different LLL subsegments
- Each biopsy: 6-second freeze time
- Prophylactic bronchial blocker placed before cryobiopsies
- Samples 4-6mm each, well-preserved architecture

SAFETY EVENTS:
- Moderate bleeding after 2nd cryobiopsy (expected)
- Controlled with blocker inflation + iced saline
- Bleeding resolved, blocker removed
- No pneumothorax on immediate post-procedure CXR

Procedure time: 67 minutes

Patient extubated in OR, recovered well, admitted for overnight observation per cryobiopsy protocol.

PATHOLOGY PENDING: Both lymph node and lung parenchymal samples for comprehensive evaluation.
