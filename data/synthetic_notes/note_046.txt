Patient Name: Thompson, Lisa Marie Medical Record: 5562789 Date of Birth: 05/20/1982 Procedure Date: 04/05/2025
Proceduralist: Dr. James Patterson Supervising Attending: Dr. James Patterson
Fellow Physician: Dr. Rebecca Stone Nursing Staff: RN Maria Gonzalez, RT Kevin Brown
INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: 42-year-old female, non-smoker, with incidental finding of right hilar mass 4.5cm and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Undergoing staging evaluation.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Endobronchial Ultrasound-Guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA)
CONSENT: Written informed consent obtained after detailed discussion
ANESTHESIA/SEDATION:
•	Topical: Lidocaine 4% to posterior pharynx, Lidocaine 2% via bronchoscope 20mL total
•	IV Sedation: Midazolam 4mg, Fentanyl 100mcg, Propofol drip 75mcg/kg/min
•	Monitoring: Continuous pulse oximetry, capnography, BP q5min, ECG
EQUIPMENT: Olympus BF-UC180F EBUS bronchoscope
PROCEDURE NARRATIVE: Time out performed confirming patient identity and procedure. EBUS bronchoscope advanced through oral cavity after adequate topical anesthesia achieved.
Mediastinal ultrasound survey:
•	Right paratracheal (Stn 2R): 14mm, normal architecture
•	Right lower paratracheal (Stn 4R): 32mm, heterogeneous, loss of central echogenic hilum, SUSPICIOUS
•	Left lower paratracheal (Stn 4L): 18mm, preserved hilum
•	Subcarinal (Stn 7): 41mm, markedly enlarged, hypoechoic throughout, SUSPICIOUS
•	Right hilar (Stn 10R): 16mm with abnormal echo pattern
•	Right interlobar (Stn 11R): 19mm
SAMPLING PROCEDURE: Station 7 (Subcarinal) - 41mm x 23mm → TBNA Pass #1 (22G): Good core, ROSE = adequate cellularity, abundant malignant cells → TBNA Pass #2 (22G): Confirming sample, ROSE = concordant → TBNA Pass #3 (22G): Additional tissue for molecular markers → TBNA Pass #4 (22G): Microbiology (sent for AFB, fungal, bacterial cultures)
Station 4R - 32mm x 19mm
→ TBNA Pass #1-3 (22G): ROSE = malignant cells identified, morphology similar to Station 7
Station 10R - 16mm x 12mm → TBNA Pass #1-2 (22G): ROSE = atypical cells present
Station 11R - 19mm x 11mm → TBNA Pass #1-2 (22G): ROSE = benign reactive lymphocytes
No endobronchial lesions visualized. Airways patent bilaterally.
COMPLICATIONS: None
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <5mL
SPECIMENS: Cytology specimens sent from stations 7, 4R, 10R, 11R. Cell blocks prepared. Tissue sent for flow cytometry and molecular analysis.
ROSE INTERPRETATION: Dr. Amanda Foster, Cytopathology
POST-PROCEDURE: Patient recovered without difficulty. Vital signs stable. Discharged to floor in good condition.
IMPRESSION:
5.	EBUS-TBNA successfully performed
6.	Malignant cells identified in stations 7 and 4R, consistent with metastatic disease
7.	N2 disease confirmed
8.	Await final pathology for definitive cell type and molecular markers
PLAN:
•	Oncology consultation
•	Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion
•	Final pathology in 3-5 business days

============ PROCEDURE REPORT ============
EXAM: EBUS with TBNA
REASON: 76M with new diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma RLL, staging of mediastinum
TECHNIQUE: Patient positioned supine. After adequate conscious sedation achieved, EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the oropharynx. Initial inspection of upper airway structures normal.
Radial survey of mediastinum performed identifying multiple lymph node stations.
LYMPH NODE MAPPING: Stn 2R: 11mm - normal appearance, not sampled Stn 4R: 24mm - round, heterogeneous echotexture
Stn 4L: 16mm - oval with preserved hilum Stn 7: 38mm - large subcarinal node, hypoechoic, irregular contour Stn 10R: 13mm - mildly prominent Stn 11R: 21mm - abnormal echo pattern
ASPIRATION DETAILS:
STATION 7 (38x21mm) Needle Type: 22-gauge EBUS needle Pass 1 @ 0847: Visible tissue in needle hub, ROSE = ADEQUATE, MALIGNANT CELLS SEEN Pass 2 @ 0849: Additional specimen obtained Pass 3 @ 0851: Sample for molecular testing Pass 4 @ 0853: Microbiology specimen (AFB, fungal cultures) Elastography: Blue pattern (hard consistency)
STATION 4R (24x15mm)
Pass 1-3: ROSE = Atypical cells, cannot exclude malignancy
STATION 11R (21x13mm) Pass 1-2: ROSE = Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia
Bronchoscope withdrawn. Patient tolerated procedure well.
Total procedure duration: 38 minutes Fluoroscopy time: 0 minutes (not used) Sedation medications: Versed 2mg, Fentanyl 50mcg, Propofol 140mg total
COMPLICATIONS: None reported
FINDINGS SUMMARY:
•	N2 disease confirmed by ROSE cytology (Station 7)
•	Station 4R with atypical cells requiring final pathology correlation
•	Station 11R benign
FINAL PATHOLOGY PENDING
