- Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy
- Radial EBUS
- Transbronchial biopsies
- Endobronchial biopsies

**CONSENT:** Obtained - all risks discussed

**VENT:** PC mode, Pinsp 20, RR 12, PEEP 5, FiO2 50%, Pmean 14

**PROCEDURE:**

**PART 1: EBUS-TBNA**

EBUS scope inserted through ETT (8.0, 23cm).

**Mediastinal Survey:**

**Station 2R:** 7mm - not sampled

**Station 4R:** 24mm - hypoechoic, heterogeneous
- 22G needle x 5 passes
- ROSE: "Positive - squamous cell carcinoma"

**Station 4L:** 19mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 4 passes
- ROSE: "Positive - squamous cell carcinoma"

**Station 7:** 28mm - large, hypoechoic, necrotic areas visible
- 22G needle x 5 passes (some passes yielded necrotic material)
- ROSE: "Positive - squamous cell carcinoma, areas of necrosis"

**Station 10L:** 22mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 4 passes
- ROSE: "Positive - squamous cell carcinoma"

**Station 11L:** 18mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 3 passes
- ROSE: "Positive - squamous cell carcinoma"

**Assessment after EBUS:** Extensive N2/N3 disease. Primary still needs biopsy for confirmation.

**PART 2: AIRWAY INSPECTION**

EBUS scope removed. Standard bronchoscope inserted.

**Finding:** LLL orifice shows endobronchial tumor - exophytic mass nearly occluding orifice, friable appearance.

**Decision:** Obtain endobronchial biopsies directly (easier/safer than navigating to peripheral component).

**Endobronchial biopsies:** 6 specimens obtained from visible LLL tumor using standard forceps.

Moderate bleeding from biopsy site. Managed with:
- Wedging bronchoscope
- Epinephrine 1:10,000, 5mL instilled
- Held position x 2 minutes
- Bleeding resolved

**ROSE (endobronchial):** "Squamous cell carcinoma - consistent with nodal samples"

**PART 3: EMN TO PERIPHERAL COMPONENT**

Despite endobronchial component, decided to sample peripheral component as well for potentially better tissue for molecular testing.

SuperDimension EMN system used. CT from 03/05/2025 loaded.

**Registration:** Auto-registration, 7 points, adequate accuracy.

**Navigation:** Attempted to navigate to LLL superior segment (peripheral component of mass). However, significant tumor in proximal airway made navigation difficult. Guide advanced as far as possible but unable to reach planned target (remained ~15mm away per system).

**Radial EBUS:** Probe advanced through guide - visualized mass with eccentric pattern but adequate for sampling.

**Peripheral sampling:**
- Forceps biopsies x 5
- Brushings x 2

**ROSE:** "Squamous cell carcinoma - adequate for molecular testing"

**TOTAL TIME:** 58 minutes

**EXTUBATION:** Uneventful, stable

**EBL:** ~30mL

2. Station 4L TBNA x4
3. Station 7 TBNA x5
4. Station 10L TBNA x4
5. Station 11L TBNA x3
6. LLL endobronchial tumor biopsies x6
7. LLL peripheral component biopsies x5 (via EMN)
8. LLL brushings x2

**ALL SPECIMENS:** Request PD-L1 testing (relevant for squamous NSCLC treatment decisions)

**COMPLICATIONS:** Moderate endobronchial bleeding - resolved with epinephrine

**FINDINGS:**
- Extensive nodal disease: N2 (stations 4R, 4L, 7) and N3 (contralateral 4L) involvement
- Primary LLL squamous cell carcinoma with endobronchial extension
- Stage: At least IIIB (T3-4N3M0)

**PLAN:**
- Complete staging: Brain MRI
- Not surgical candidate due to extent of nodal disease
- Medical oncology consult - definitive chemoradiation vs clinical trial
- PD-L1 results may influence systemic therapy choice
- F/u 1 week IP clinic

Post-op CXR: No PTX

Preliminary findings: "ADEQUATE sample. POSITIVE for malignancy. Adenocarcinoma, consistent with Stations 5 and 7."

**STATION 11L (Interlobar):**
- Ultrasound: 12 mm, appears reactive
- **Not sampled** (diagnostic yield already achieved from other stations)

**EBUS Summary:**

- N1 disease documented (Station 10L - ipsilateral hilar N1)
- Extensive nodal involvement consistent with advanced disease
**PART II: ELECTROMAGNETIC NAVIGATION BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PRIMARY LESION**

After completing EBUS, the EBUS bronchoscope was removed.

A standard therapeutic bronchoscope (Olympus BF-1TH190) was introduced through the ETT for EMN bronchoscopy.

**Standard Bronchoscopy - Airway Survey:**

Detailed inspection of tracheobronchial tree:

*Right lung:*
- Right upper lobe: Anterior, apical, and posterior segments - all patent
- Right middle lobe: Medial and lateral segments - patent
- Right lower lobe: Superior, medial basal, anterior basal, lateral basal, posterior basal segments - all patent
- No endobronchial lesions identified

*Left lung:*
- Left upper lobe: Apical-posterior segment - patent
- Left upper lobe: Anterior segment - patent
- Lingula: Superior and inferior segments - patent
- Left lower lobe: Superior segment - patent
- **Left lower lobe: Basilar segments (medial/anterior/lateral/posterior) - mild narrowing of ostia likely from external compression by mass, but patent**
- No discrete endobronchial tumor visible (mass appears primarily parenchymal)

Secretion management: Minimal thin clear secretions throughout, suctioned clear

**Electromagnetic Navigation Setup:**

System: SuperDimension iLogic Electromagnetic Navigation Platform

**CT Planning:**
- CT chest with IV contrast dated 04/02/2025 loaded onto navigation workstation
- 3D reconstruction performed
- Target identified: LLL posterior basal segment mass (3.6 cm, irregular/spiculated margins, approximately 2.8 cm from pleural surface)

**Virtual Pathway Planning:**
Pathway created through the following anatomic route:
- Trachea
- Left main stem bronchus
- Left lower lobe bronchus
- Posterior basal segmental bronchus
- Subsegmental branches (2 levels)

**Registration Phase:**

Registration method: Automatic registration protocol

Process:
1. Electromagnetic field generator positioned under procedure table
2. Locatable guide with position sensors inserted through bronchoscope working channel
3. Locatable guide advanced through airways while system tracks position
4. Automated landmark identification and matching to CT dataset

Registration landmarks confirmed:
- Carina (primary reference point)
- Left main stem bronchus takeoff
- LUL/Lingula/LLL trifurcation
- LLL segmental anatomy (superior, basilar divisions)
- Posterior basal segmental bronchus
- Subsegmental branch points (levels 1 and 2)

Registration quality metrics:
- Number of registration points: 9 confirmed
- System accuracy indicator: 93% (green/acceptable)
- Estimated target error: <6 mm per system calculations
- Visual inspection of overlay: Good concordance between virtual and live bronchoscopic views

Time to complete registration: 12 minutes

**Navigation Phase:**

The extended working channel (EWC) with locatable guide (LG) was assembled and prepared.

The EWC/LG system was advanced through the bronchoscope working channel under electromagnetic navigational guidance.

Real-time position tracking displayed on navigation monitor showing:
- Current position of catheter tip
- Planned pathway
- Distance to target
- 3D anatomic orientation

Navigation progress:
- Trachea to left main stem: On trajectory
- Left main stem to LLL: On trajectory
- LLL to posterior basal segment: On trajectory, minimal deviation
- Posterior basal to subsegmental branches: Required minor repositioning (system indicated 3mm anterior adjustment needed, performed successfully)
- Final positioning: Catheter advanced to deepest safe depth in subsegmental airways

**Final Navigation Metrics:**
- Tool-to-target distance: 0.9 cm (displayed on system)
- Navigation confidence score: High (per system algorithm)
- Time to navigate to target: 8 minutes

**Radial EBUS Confirmation:**

After achieving navigational target, radial EBUS probe (20 MHz, UM-S20-20R) was introduced through the extended working channel to confirm lesion localization.

**Initial rEBUS findings:**
- Pattern: Eccentric (lesion visualized but not centered around probe)
- Lesion characteristics: Hypoechoic mass with irregular, spiculated margins
- Size: Approximately 32 mm in maximum dimension
- Internal echo: Heterogeneous

**Catheter adjustment:**
- Based on eccentric pattern, catheter advanced 4 mm deeper and rotated slightly
- Repeat rEBUS performed

**Optimized rEBUS findings:**
- Pattern: Concentric (lesion now centered around probe - OPTIMAL for sampling)
- Confirmation of same lesion characteristics
- Distance to pleura: Estimated 2.5-3.0 cm (safe sampling distance)
- Vascular assessment: No large vessels immediately adjacent to planned sampling trajectory

**rEBUS photos captured and saved to patient record**

Radial probe removed, extended working channel/locatable guide maintained in position for sampling.

**Tissue Acquisition:**

All sampling performed through the extended working channel with guide sheath in place (maintains position after probe removal).

**Transbronchial Forceps Biopsies:**
- Forceps type: Standard cup forceps
- Number of passes: 8 biopsies obtained
- Technique: Forceps advanced through EWC to target depth (guided by most recent rEBUS position), opened, advanced 1-2cm, closed, withdrawn
- Quality assessment: Adequate tissue fragments visualized on all 8 passes
- Specimen handling: All specimens placed in formalin container for histopathology

**Cytology Brushings:**
- Brush type: Disposable cytology brush
- Number of passes: 4
- Technique: Brush advanced through EWC, extended, rotated, withdrawn
- Specimen handling:
  - Brushes 1-2: Smeared on glass slides (air-dried and alcohol-fixed)
  - Brushes 3-4: Agitated in CytoLyt solution

**Bronchoalveolar Lavage:**
- Location: LLL posterior basal segment (same segment as target lesion)
- Volume instilled: 100 mL sterile 0.9% normal saline (divided into 2 x 50mL aliquots)
- Volume returned: 48 mL
- Fluid appearance: Slightly blood-tinged (expected post-biopsy), moderate turbidity
- Specimens sent for:
  - Cytology
  - Bacterial culture
  - Fungal culture
  - Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) culture and smear

**ROSE - Primary Lesion (Dr. Chen):**

Preliminary assessment of brushing specimens:

"ADEQUATE cellular sample. Malignant epithelial cells identified. Cells demonstrate glandular differentiation with acinar formation. Nuclear features similar to previously sampled lymph nodes. Morphology consistent with ADENOCARCINOMA.

Recommend: Full histopathologic evaluation of tissue biopsies. Request comprehensive molecular testing including EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, PD-L1, and broader next-generation sequencing panel given never-smoker status and treatment implications."

**Hemostasis Assessment:**

After completing all sampling, airways were re-inspected:
- Mild oozing from biopsy site in LLL posterior basal segment
- Self-limited - no intervention required
- Continued observation for 2 minutes
- Complete cessation of bleeding confirmed

**FINDINGS SUMMARY:**

**Based on Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):**

**Primary Tumor:**
- Left lower lobe mass: ADENOCARCINOMA confirmed

**Lymph Node Staging:**
- Station 5 (Aortopulmonary window - contralateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N3 disease)
- Station 7 (Subcarinal - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N2 disease)
- Station 10L (Left hilar - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N1 disease)

**Preliminary Staging:**
- Primary tumor (T): T2b (3.6 cm)
- Regional lymph nodes (N): N3 (contralateral mediastinal node involvement)
- Distant metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastases identified on PET/CT)
- **Overall Stage: IIIB (T2bN3M0)**

This represents locally advanced disease with contralateral mediastinal lymph node involvement.
**CLINICAL ASSESSMENT & DISCUSSION:**

**Diagnosis:** Stage IIIB Adenocarcinoma of the Left Lower Lobe

**Significance:**
- This is locally advanced lung cancer with extensive nodal involvement
- N3 disease (contralateral mediastinal node) makes this unresectable by surgical standards
- Patient is NOT a surgical candidate given extent of nodal disease
- Will require systemic therapy +/- radiation

**Prognostic Factors - FAVORABLE:**
- Former smoker (quit 8 years ago) - intermediate prognosis
- Good performance status (ECOG 1)
- Age 61 - relatively young
- Histology: Adenocarcinoma (better prognosis than squamous, more treatment options)

**Prognostic Factors - UNFAVORABLE:**
- Stage IIIB with N3 disease
- Large primary tumor (3.6 cm)
- Multilevel nodal involvement (N1, N2, N3)

**Treatment Implications:**
- Primary treatment: Concurrent chemoimmunotherapy followed by consolidation immunotherapy (PACIFIC trial paradigm)
- Alternative: Sequential chemotherapy → radiation, or clinical trial
- Role of radiation: Definitive radiation therapy to primary + involved nodal stations
- Surgical resection: Not indicated given N3 disease
- Molecular testing results will be CRITICAL:
  - If EGFR/ALK/ROS1 positive: Consider targeted therapy incorporation
  - PD-L1 status: Guides immunotherapy selection
  - Other actionable mutations: May have clinical trial options

**Awaiting:**
- Final histopathology confirmation (2-3 business days)
- Comprehensive molecular testing (7-14 days, expedite if possible)
- Formal staging completion (see below)
**PLAN & FOLLOW-UP:**
