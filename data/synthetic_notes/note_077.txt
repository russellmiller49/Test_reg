PROCEDURE NOTE:
68 y.o. male with 60 pack-year smoking history presents with LLL mass on staging CT. PET shows SUV 8.9. Mediastinal nodes negative. Patient consented for diagnostic bronch and fiducial placement for possible SBRT.

Intubated by anesthesia without difficulty. ETT 8.0 at 23 cm.

VENT: VC, TV 500, RR 14, PEEP 5, FiO2 45%, Flow 55, Pmean 11

CT from 11/20/2024 loaded to Ion station. Navigation plan created to LLL superior segment mass. Automatic registration completed. Fiducial error 1.4mm - acceptable.

Ion catheter deployed. Initial navigation showed 8mm deviation at target - reregistration performed with improved accuracy (error 0.9mm).

Radial probe inserted through Ion working channel. Eccentric pattern visualized - lesion 36mm diameter. Probe withdrawn, biopsy tools inserted.

Obtained:
• 8 transbronchial biopsies (formalin)
• 3 brush specimens (cytopathology)
• Bronchial washings (cytology, AFB, fungal, bacterial cx)

ROSE: highly cellular, malignant cells consistent with squamous cell carcinoma

Fiducial marker (0.8x3mm gold CIVCO) placed in LLL anterior segmental bronchus under fluoroscopy - confirmed adequate position for radiation planning.

Post-procedure: hemostasis confirmed, no bleeding. Patient extubated, stable vitals, transferred to recovery.

PLAN: Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion. Likely SBRT candidate given node-negative disease. F/u 1 week.

**Chief Complaint:** Incidental pulmonary nodule

**HPI:** Patient with history of breast cancer (2018, in remission) found to have 1.8cm RML nodule on surveillance CT. PET shows mild uptake SUV 2.8. Presents for tissue diagnosis.

**Procedure Performed:** Robotic bronchoscopy (Intuitive Ion platform), radial endobronchial ultrasound, transbronchial biopsy

**Informed Consent:** Reviewed risks of bleeding (1-5%), pneumothorax (1-2%), infection, need for chest tube, respiratory compromise. Patient consented.

**Anesthesia:** GETA by Dr. Steven Kim. MAC #7.5 ETT, depth 21cm at teeth.

**Ventilator Parameters:** SIMV, Rate 12, Vt 400mL, PEEP 5, FiO2 50%, I:E 1:2

**Technique:**
Preoperative CT dated 12/28/2024 uploaded to Ion planning workstation. Virtual pathway generated to RML medial segment nodule.

Registration protocol: Automatic method employed. Carina, RUL/RML/RLL carinas, and segmental bifurcations matched. Global alignment quality: excellent. Mean fiducial registration error: 1.1mm.

Ion robotic catheter navigated along planned trajectory. Distance to target: 0.8cm at final position.

Radial EBUS probe (1.4mm) inserted - demonstrated concentric hypoechoic pattern, lesion diameter 17mm, well-circumscribed borders.

CBCT performed (NaviLink 3D fusion): Overlay confirmed catheter within lesion volume. Margin from lesion center: 2mm.

**Samples obtained:**
- TBBx x 5 (histopathology)
- Cytology brush x 2
- BAL from RML (cell count, micro)

**ROSE:** Adequate sample. Bronchioloalveolar cells, no malignancy identified in initial review. (Final cytology pending)

**Findings:**
- Upper airway: normal
- Trachea: patent, no masses
- Carina: sharp, mobile
- Right bronchial tree: patent, no endobronchial lesions
- Left bronchial tree: not fully examined given unilateral target

**Complications:** None
**EBL:** Minimal
**Condition:** Stable, extubated, to PACU

**Assessment/Plan:**
Successful robotic bronchoscopy with biopsy of RML nodule. ROSE shows no definitive malignancy but final pathology pending. If benign, plan for 3-month interval CT surveillance per Fleischner criteria. Patient to follow up in clinic 2 weeks for pathology review.
