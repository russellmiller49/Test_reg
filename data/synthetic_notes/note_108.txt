Patient: Mark Thompson | MRN# TK-9472 | Born: 09/03/1964

INDICATION: RLL 21mm solid nodule with clear bronchus sign on CT, PET SUV 4.8

ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation, midazolam 3mg + fentanyl 75mcg
Ramsay 3 throughout, monitoring BP q5min, SpO2 continuous

TECHNIQUE: Traditional bronchoscopy (no navigation system needed due to bronchus sign)

Procedure:
- Thin bronchoscope advanced to RLL
- Bronchus sign followed to nodule location
- Lesion visualized endobronchially as subtle mucosal irregularity
- Radial EBUS probe: Solid eccentric pattern consistent with lesion
- Fluoroscopy used for confirmation: 3.1 minutes, DAP 124 cGy*cm²

Sampling performed:
- Transbronchial needle aspiration ×3 (22G Wang needle)
- Transbronchial forceps biopsy ×5
- Brush cytology ×2
- Additional forceps biopsies ×3 for molecular testing

Tool approach successful, diagnostic yield anticipated given direct visualization

Complications: Minor self-limited bleeding after forceps biopsies, resolved with gentle suction

Post-procedure: CXR showed small basilar atelectasis, no PTX. Patient stable, discharged.
