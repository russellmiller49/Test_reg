PATIENT: William Harris, 68-year-old Male
MRN: 8127065
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: Mr. Harris is a 68-year-old male with severe heterogeneous emphysema (FEV1 28% predicted) despite maximal medical therapy including pulmonary rehabilitation. CT imaging shows target left upper lobe with fissure integrity >95%. Chartis assessment confirms absence of collateral ventilation. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to endobronchial valve therapy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe heterogeneous emphysema with target left upper lobe
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same
PROCEDURE: Endobronchial Valve Placement (CPT 31647, 31648)
ATTENDING: Dr. Catherine Lee
ASSISTANT: Dr. Brian Thompson, Fellow
Support Staff:

RN: Michelle Rodriguez
RT: Steven Clark
Anesthesia: Dr. Jennifer Adams

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation
MONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring
INSTRUMENT: Olympus therapeutic bronchoscope, Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System, Zephyr Endobronchial Valves (Pulmonx)
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After induction of general anesthesia and intubation with 8.5 ETT, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived. Patient received Cefazolin 2g IV and Methylprednisolone 125mg IV prior to procedure.
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
The bronchoscope was introduced through the ETT. Complete airway survey showed:

Trachea: Normal
Right lung: Patent airways, emphysematous changes
Left lung: Patent airways with severe emphysematous destruction especially in upper lobe segments

Chartis Assessment:
Balloon occlusion of the left upper lobe was performed at the LUL orifice using the Chartis balloon catheter. The balloon was inflated with saline to achieve complete occlusion confirmed visually and by loss of airflow.
Chartis Results:

Test duration: 6 minutes
Flow: Declined to zero by minute 4
Resistance: Progressive increase
Conclusion: CV NEGATIVE (no collateral ventilation detected)

Based on Chartis confirmation of absent collateral ventilation, proceeded with valve placement.
Valve Placement:
The following Zephyr Endobronchial Valves were deployed:

LB1+2 (Apical-posterior segment): 4.0mm valve
LB1+2c (Anterior segment): 4.0mm valve
LB3 (Superior segment): 4.0mm valve

All valves were deployed under direct visualization using the Zephyr Loading System. Each valve expanded appropriately and demonstrated one-way valve function with visible flutter during expiration and occlusion during inspiration. Final bronchoscopic inspection confirmed:

All three valves in good position
Complete LUL occlusion achieved
No airflow detected through valves
No immediate complications

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Lee, was present throughout the entire procedure.
SPECIMEN(S): None
IMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Harris underwent successful endobronchial valve placement in the left upper lobe for severe emphysema. Post-procedure management per protocol:
Post-BLVR Protocol:

Admit to monitored bed
Pneumothorax kit at bedside
Continuous pulse oximetry and telemetry
CXR immediately post-procedure and at 4 hours
Day 1: Bedrest, resume home COPD medications
Day 2-4: Progressive mobilization with daily CXRs
Discharge planning on Day 4 if stable
Follow-up IP clinic in 2 weeks with repeat CXR and PFTs in 6 weeks

Patient and family counseled on 30-35% pneumothorax risk and when to seek emergency care.
