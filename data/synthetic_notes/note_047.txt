0920 - Propofol infusion initiated 50mcg/kg/min, titrated to effect (max 125mcg/kg/min) Total Propofol: 285mg
TOPICAL ANESTHESIA: Lidocaine 4% spray to oropharynx x3 applications Lidocaine 2% instilled via working channel: 15mL total
BRONCHOSCOPE: Fujifilm EB-530US (Ultrasound capable)
==PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION==
EBUS bronchoscope introduced via oral route. Vocal cords visualized, normal mobility. Trachea without masses or significant narrowing. Carina sharp.
ULTRASOUND SURVEY FINDINGS:
RIGHT PARATRACHEAL (2R): 9mm, normal hilum - NOT SAMPLED RIGHT LOWER PARATRACHEAL (4R): 31mm x 18mm, hypoechoic, loss of hilum LEFT LOWER PARATRACHEAL (4L): 27mm x 15mm, heterogeneous echotexture
SUBCARINAL (7): 45mm x 28mm, MARKEDLY ENLARGED, diffusely hypoechoic RIGHT HILAR (10R): 14mm, mildly prominent LEFT HILAR (10L): 22mm, round, abnormal architecture RIGHT INTERLOBAR (11R): 18mm
SAMPLING PERFORMED:
[STATION 7 - SUBCARINAL] Dimensions: 45 x 28mm | Position: Between LMB and RMB Pass 1 (0932): 22G needle, suction applied, 20 excursions, excellent tissue visible ROSE: Adequate specimen, large atypical lymphoid cells, recommend flow cytometry Pass 2 (0934): Additional material for flow cytometry Pass 3 (0936): Cell block preparation
Pass 4 (0938): Microbiology specimen sent for cultures Complications: None, minimal bleeding controlled with suction
[STATION 4R] Dimensions: 31 x 18mm Pass 1-3 (0942-0946): ROSE: Atypical lymphoid proliferation, similar to Station 7
[STATION 10L]
Dimensions: 22 x 14mm Pass 1-2 (0949-0951): ROSE: Lymphoid cells present, flow recommended
[STATION 11R] Dimensions: 18 x 11mm Pass 1-2 (0953-0955): ROSE: Benign reactive lymphoid tissue
Bronchoscope withdrawn at 0958. Total procedure time: 43 minutes.
SPECIMENS SUBMITTED:
•	Cytology: Stations 7, 4R, 10L, 11R
•	Flow cytometry: Stations 7, 4R, 10L
•	Cell block: Station 7
•	Microbiology: Station 7 (AFB, fungal, bacterial cultures)
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
PATIENT TOLERANCE: Good, no desaturation episodes, hemodynamically stable throughout
POST-PROCEDURE:
•	Monitoring in recovery area
•	Diet: NPO x 2hrs then advance as tolerated
•	Activity: Bedrest x 2hrs
•	F/U: Results discussed when final path available
IMPRESSION: Successful EBUS-TBNA with sampling of multiple mediastinal lymph node stations. ROSE cytology demonstrates atypical lymphoid proliferation concerning for lymphoma. Flow cytometry and final pathology pending for definitive diagnosis.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
4.	Hematology/Oncology consultation
5.	PET-CT for staging once diagnosis confirmed
6.	Follow up in IP clinic in 1 week for pathology review
