Proc: EBUS with needle biopsies
Why: Right lung cancer, check if spread to lymph nodes
Consent: Yes
Drugs for sedation: Versed + Fentanyl + Propofol
What we saw with ultrasound:
•	Big node under airway split (station 7): 31mm
•	Node on right neck area (station 4R): 24mm
•	Node at right lung entrance (station 10R): 16mm
•	Small node inside right lung (station 11R): 13mm
What we did: Stuck needle in nodes to get samples
Station 7: 4 times Doctor looked right away = CANCER CELLS (adenocarcinoma)
Station 4R: 3 times
Quick look = CANCER
Station 10R: 2 times Quick look = CANCER
Station 11R: 2 times Quick look = Normal node
What this means: Cancer in 3 different lymph node spots = N2 disease = Stage 3
No problems
Plan:
•	See cancer doctor
•	More tests
•	Decide treatment

══════════════════════════════════════════
TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
IMMEDIATE (Within 1 week): □ URGENT Medical Oncology Consultation Scheduled for 04/10/2025 with Dr. Sarah Mitchell
□ Multidisciplinary Tumor Board Presentation Thursday conference 04/11/2025 Teams: Medical oncology, radiation oncology, thoracic surgery, pulmonology, radiology, pathology
□ Patient/Family Conference Schedule dedicated time to discuss:
•	Diagnosis of adenocarcinoma
•	Stage IIIC disease
•	Treatment options
•	Prognosis
•	Goals of care
STAGING COMPLETION: □ Brain MRI with contrast (ORDERED - to evaluate for metastases) High priority given advanced nodal disease
□ Abdominal/Pelvic CT (if not recent) Evaluate for distant metastases
□ Bone scan or PET-CT total body May already have sufficient information from recent PET
AWAITING RESULTS (3-7 business days): □ Final cytopathology report □ Molecular testing results (CRITICAL for treatment selection):
•	EGFR mutations → Consider EGFR TKI if positive
•	ALK rearrangement → Consider ALK inhibitor if positive
•	ROS1 rearrangement → Consider ROS1 inhibitor if positive
•	PD-L1 expression → Impacts immunotherapy decisions
•	Comprehensive NGS → May identify other actionable mutations
TREATMENT OPTIONS (pending molecular results): □ Systemic Chemotherapy Standard platinum-doublet regimen
□ Targeted Therapy If actionable mutation identified (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, etc.)
□ Immunotherapy Consider based on PD-L1 expression, may combine with chemotherapy
□ Radiation Therapy Role to be determined - may be palliative or consolidative
□ Clinical Trial Evaluate eligibility for appropriate trials
SUPPORTIVE CARE: □ Palliative Care Consultation Early integration recommended for symptom management and goals of care discussions
□ Social Work Financial counseling, support services
□ Nutrition Address weight loss, optimize nutritional status
□ Patient Navigator Coordinate care, appointments, resources
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: □ Interventional Pulmonology Clinic: 1 week (04/15/2025) Review final pathology and molecular results
□ Medical Oncology: 04/10/2025 (already scheduled)
□ Tumor Board Results Discussion: Following 04/11 conference
PATIENT EDUCATION PROVIDED: □ Explained diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma □ Discussed staging (Stage IIIC - advanced but not metastatic) □ Reviewed that surgery is not an option due to extent of lymph node involvement □ Explained importance of molecular testing for treatment selection □ Discussed general treatment approach (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy) □ Set realistic expectations about prognosis □ Provided written materials on lung cancer □ Gave contact information for lung cancer support groups □ Reviewed warning signs: fever, severe chest pain, coughing up blood, severe shortness of breath □ Encouraged questions - patient and family very engaged and understanding
