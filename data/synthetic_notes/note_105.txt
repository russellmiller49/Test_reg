Indication â†’ Central airway obstruction from endobronchial tumor, RML bronchus

Sedation protocol: General anesthesia via LMA, propofol + remifentanil infusion
Monitoring: Continuous arterial line, SpO2, ETCO2, BP q3min

Procedure narrative:
Inspection revealed near-complete obstruction of RML bronchus by exophytic tumor with friable surface. Tumor debulking performed using:
- Electrocautery snare for bulk removal
- Argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis
- Cryotherapy x2 freeze-thaw cycles

Massive hemorrhage encountered during debulking (estimated 200mL). Bleeding controlled with:
- Topical epinephrine 1:10,000
- Iced saline lavage
- Bronchial blocker placement temporarily

Silicone stent (14mm x 40mm) placed in RML bronchus for airway patency.

Complications: Major airway bleeding (moderate severity) - controlled during procedure. Patient stable.

Plan: Follow-up bronchoscopy in 4-6 weeks for stent assessment and tumor surveillance.
