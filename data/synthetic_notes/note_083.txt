Patient Name: David Kim
MRN: 5938271
Date of Procedure: February 20, 2025

Proceduralist(s): Amanda Rodriguez, MD

Anesthesia/Medications:
• General anesthesia with 8.5 ETT placement
• Topical anesthesia (6 cc 1% lidocaine)
• Additional intravenous medications per institutional protocol

Indications: Bilateral lung masses
Pre-Procedure Diagnosis: Suspected lung malignancy
Post-Procedure Diagnosis: Suspected lung malignancy

Consent: The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient (or surrogate). Informed consent was obtained and documented per institutional protocol.

Time-Out: A formal time-out was performed confirming the patient's identity, procedure, and site.

I. Initial Airway Inspection

Findings:
• The flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the 8.5 ETT and advanced into the trachea
• The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina
• The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level
• Inspection notable for an endobronchial fungating mass in the RUL obstructing the superior and anterior segments
• The remaining airways appeared normal with no additional endobronchial abnormalities, mucosal irregularities, or abnormal secretions

II. Tissue Sampling Procedures

A. Right Upper Lobe (RUL) Endobronchial Biopsy
• An endobronchial mass was identified obstructing the superior and anterior segments of the RUL
• Sampling Techniques:
  - Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA): Performed using Periview Flex transbronchial needle with five (5) passes
  - Endobronchial Forceps Biopsy: Performed with six (6) samples obtained
  - Hemostasis: Moderate bleeding noted, successfully controlled with instillation of 2 cc of topical epinephrine

B. Left Lower Lobe (LLL) Lesion Biopsy
• A second lesion was identified in the superior segment of the LLL using radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with a concentric view
• Sampling Techniques:
  - Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA): Performed using Periview Flex with four (4) passes
  - Transbronchial Forceps Biopsy: Performed with five (5) samples obtained
  - Hemostasis: Moderate bleeding noted, successfully controlled with instillation of 2 cc of topical epinephrine

C. Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) - Left Lower Lobe (LLL) Superior Segment
• A BAL was performed in the superior segment of the left lower lobe
• Instillation: 110 cc normal saline
• Return: 20 cc
• Samples sent for cytology, microbiology (bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures), and differential cell count

D. Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE)
• Right Upper Lobe (RUL) lesion: ROSE interpretation was malignant
• Left Lower Lobe (LLL) lesion: ROSE revealed abundant necrosis but pathology was unable to definitively confirm malignancy

III. Final Airway Re-Inspection and Conclusion

Findings:
• No active bleeding was noted on final airway inspection
• No evidence of airway compromise

Estimated Blood Loss: Moderate, successfully controlled with topical epinephrine
Complications: No immediate complications

Disposition/Plan:
• The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition
• Post-procedure CXR was performed to rule out pneumothorax or other complications
• Pathology, cytology, and microbiology results are pending
• Follow-up bronchoscopy and multidisciplinary evaluation will be planned based on final pathology results
