PATIENT: Linda Chen, 72-year-old Female
MRN: 4783621
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: Ms. Chen is a 72-year-old female with known squamous cell lung cancer presenting with worsening dyspnea and stridor. CT chest shows near-complete obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus by endobronchial tumor. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to therapeutic bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left mainstem bronchus obstruction secondary to endobronchial tumor
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same
PROCEDURE: Rigid Bronchoscopy, Endobronchial Tumor Destruction (CPT 31641), Mechanical Tumor Debridement (CPT 31640), Airway Stent Placement (CPT 31631)
ATTENDING: Dr. Michael Anderson
ASSISTANT: Dr. Sarah Kim, Fellow
Support Staff:

RN: Robert Martinez
RT: Lisa Johnson
Anesthesia: Dr. Thomas Wright

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with TIVA
MONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring with arterial line
INSTRUMENT: Storz rigid bronchoscope (14mm), Olympus flexible bronchoscope, Electrocautery (Bovie), APC probe, mechanical debrider, 14mm x 60mm silicone stent (Dumon)
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150 mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT POSITION: Supine with shoulder roll
A rigid bronchoscope (14mm) was introduced via the mouth under direct visualization. High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) was utilized. A complete airway survey was performed.
Initial Findings:

Trachea: Patent, no lesions
Right mainstem: Patent, mucosa normal
Left mainstem: 90% obstructed by friable, hemorrhagic endobronchial tumor starting 1cm distal to the carina and extending 3cm distally

Therapeutic Interventions:
1. Mechanical Debridement: The tumor was cored using the rigid bronchoscope with mechanical debridement. Multiple passes were required to remove bulk tumor. Estimated tumor volume removed: 15cc.
2. Electrocautery: Residual tumor base was treated with electrocautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. Total treatment time: 3 minutes. FiO2 maintained at 40% during cautery.
3. Argon Plasma Coagulation: APC was applied to residual tumor at 40 watts, argon flow 1.5 L/min. Treatment applied circumferentially to tumor base. Duration: 2 minutes.
Results: Prior to treatment, left mainstem bronchus was 10% patent. After treatment, the airway was 70% patent.
4. Stent Placement: Due to significant malacia and risk of re-obstruction, a 14mm x 60mm Dumon silicone stent was deployed in the left mainstem bronchus under direct visualization and fluoroscopic guidance. Stent position confirmed endoscopically with good apposition to airway wall.
Hemostasis was confirmed with minimal oozing controlled with topical epinephrine (1:10,000 dilution, 10mL instilled). A flexible bronchoscope was passed through the rigid barrel for final inspection showing:

Patent stent lumen
Visible LUL and LLL orifices through stent
No significant bleeding

The bronchoscope and adjunct instruments were withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
SPECIMEN(S):

Endobronchial tumor debridement (histology)

IMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Chen is a 72-year-old female with squamous cell lung cancer and critical left mainstem obstruction. Successful therapeutic bronchoscopy with tumor debridement, cautery, APC, and stent placement. Airway patency improved from 10% to 70%. Patient will require surveillance bronchoscopy in 4-6 weeks. Oncology to follow for systemic therapy planning.
