Bronch Procedure Summary

Pt: Anderson, David C. | 58M | MRN: 7392048
DOS: 03/28/2025
MD: Julia Ramirez (attending) + Tom Sanders (fellow)

**Why:** RUL nodule, 2.7cm, spiculated, SUV 7.2, heavy smoker

**What we did:** EMN bronch, radial EBUS, TBBx

**How it went:**

Used superDimension system. CT from 3/14 loaded. Target = RUL posterior segment.

Auto-registration done - looked good, 7 points matched.

Navigated to target with locatable guide. Got to about 6mm from target per system.

REBUS showed concentric pattern, lesion ~25mm, irregular margins, solid appearance.

Biopsied through guide sheath:
- 7 forceps biopsies (good tissue each time)
- 3 brushings
- Washing for micro + cyto

ROSE = Dr. Park says "definite malignancy, squamous features"

No bleeding. Patient did great. CXR ordered.

**Specimens:**
- TBBx x7 → path (formalin)
- Brushings x3 → cyto
- Washing → micro/cyto

**Next steps:**
Stage (brain MRI, confirm PET covers everything), tumor board, likely surgery candidate given isolated RUL lesion, good PFTs. F/u 1 wk.
