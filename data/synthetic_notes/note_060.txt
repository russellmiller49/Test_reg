│ DATE │ 03/30/2025
│PROCEDURE│ EBUS-TBNA │PROVIDER │ Yang, Peter MD, PhD │FELLOW │ Morrison, Ashley MD
═══ CLINICAL SCENARIO ═══
54F never-smoker with cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) on CT, hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy. R/O sarcoid vs ILD vs atypical infection vs occult malignancy.
PET shows moderate FDG uptake nodes at 4R, 7, 10R (SUV 3-4 range)
Labs: Normal CBC, CMP. ACE level elevated at 82 (normal <40)
═══ INFORMED CONSENT ═══ Risks discussed: bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, failure to diagnose, need additional procedures. Patient agreed, signed consent form.
═══ ANESTHESIA PROTOCOL ═══ Moderate conscious sedation
•	Midazolam 2mg IV at T=0
•	Fentanyl 50mcg IV at T=2min
•	Propofol 20mg IV boluses PRN (total 80mg)
Topical:
•	Hurricane spray (benzocaine 20%) to posterior pharynx
•	Lidocaine 2% via bronchoscope: 16mL instilled incrementally
Vitals stable throughout, SpO2 92-96% on 4L NC
═══ EQUIPMENT ═══ Pentax EB-1970UK Linear EBUS Bronchoscope Ultrasound: Hi Vision Preirus Needles: 22G Olympus
═══ FINDINGS ═══
AIRWAY EXAM: Normal vocal cord function Trachea patent, no stenosis Main carina sharp Bilateral airways patent Mild inflammatory changes bilateral lower lobes
ULTRASOUND LYMPH NODE SURVEY:
Station 2R: 10mm, normal architecture Station 4R: 22mm x 13mm └─ Heterogeneous echotexture
└─ Oval shape, maintained borders
Station 4L: 18mm x 11mm └─ Similar appearance to 4R
Station 7: 29mm x 19mm └─ Enlarged └─ Hypoechoic └─ Loss of normal hilum
Station 10R: 19mm x 12mm └─ Round morphology └─ Abnormal echo pattern
Station 11R: 16mm x 10mm └─ Mildly enlarged
TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION:
► STATION 7 [29mm] Pass 1 (1022): Good aspirate obtained → ROSE: ADEQUATE. Non-necrotizing granulomas with giant cells. Pass 2 (1024): Confirmatory → ROSE: Consistent granulomatous inflammation. NO MALIGNANCY. Pass 3 (1026): Microbiology specimen → Sent for AFB, fungal, bacterial cultures Pass 4 (1028): Flow cytometry (r/o lymphoma) → Preliminary: Polyclonal lymphoid population
► STATION 4R [22mm]
Pass 1-2 (1031-1033): → ROSE: Granulomas present, similar to Station 7
► STATION 10R [19mm] Pass 1-2 (1036-1038): → ROSE: Granulomatous inflammation
► STATION 11R [16mm] Pass 1 (1040): → ROSE: Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia with granulomas
Hemostasis confirmed after each sampling. No significant bleeding noted.
═══ RAPID ON-SITE EVALUATION ═══ Cytopathologist: Dr. Rachel Cohen
All sampled stations show NON-NECROTIZING GRANULOMAS with multinucleated giant cells. No caseation. No malignancy. No organisms on preliminary AFB stain.
INTERPRETATION: Findings most consistent with SARCOIDOSIS
═══ SPECIMENS ═══ □ Cytology: Stations 7, 4R, 10R, 11R (4 vials) □ Cell blocks: Station 7 (1 vial) □ Flow cytometry: Station 7 (1 tube) □ Microbiology: Station 7 • AFB culture (1 vial) • Fungal culture (1 vial) • Bacterial culture (1 vial)
═══ PROCEDURAL DATA ═══ Start time: 1015 End time: 1048 Duration: 33 minutes Needle passes: 9 total Fluoroscopy: Not used EBL: <5mL
═══ COMPLICATIONS ═══ None
═══ POST-PROCEDURE ═══ Patient tolerated well Recovered from sedation appropriately
Vital signs stable No respiratory distress Discharged to home after 90-minute observation
═══ ASSESSMENT ═══
2.	Successful EBUS-TBNA with adequate tissue sampling
3.	ROSE cytology consistent with SARCOIDOSIS (Stage II - bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy)
4.	No evidence of malignancy
5.	Final pathology and cultures pending
═══ PLAN ═══
▶ FOLLOW-UP:
•	Pulmonology clinic 2 weeks
•	Review final pathology and culture results
•	If cultures negative: Confirm diagnosis sarcoidosis
▶ ADDITIONAL TESTING:
•	PFTs with DLCO (if not recent)
•	Ophthalmology evaluation (baseline exam)
•	24-hour urine calcium
•	Vitamin D level
▶ TREATMENT CONSIDERATION:
•	If symptomatic → Consider systemic corticosteroids
•	If asymptomatic → Observe, serial imaging
•	COP vs sarcoid discussion: Imaging and clinical context favor sarcoid, biopsy confirms
▶ PATIENT EDUCATION:
•	Sarcoidosis diagnosis explained
•	Prognosis discussed (generally favorable)
•	Written materials provided
•	Support group information given
