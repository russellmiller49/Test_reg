PROBLEM LIST:
#1 Mediastinal lymphadenopathy - needs tissue diagnosis
#2 History of breast cancer (2019) - in remission
#3 Chronic kidney disease stage 3

SUBJECTIVE: 70F referred for EBUS evaluation of mediastinal nodes found on surveillance CT. Denies chest pain, hemoptysis, dyspnea. No PET scan performed due to renal dysfunction.

OBJECTIVE:
Procedure: EBUS-TBNA
Sedation: Moderate (midazolam 2mg, fentanyl 50mcg) - limited doses due to CKD
Ramsay: 3
Vitals: Stable throughout, BP 128-142/75-82, SpO2 96-99% on RA

Findings:
- Station 2R: 8mm, sampled x3, ROSE shows metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with breast primary
- Station 4R: 12mm, sampled x4, ROSE positive for metastatic carcinoma
- Station 7: 9mm, sampled x3, ROSE positive for metastatic carcinoma

Systematic evaluation performed. All accessible stations photographed.

ASSESSMENT:
#1 Mediastinal lymphadenopathy - metastatic breast cancer confirmed
#2 Breast cancer - recurrent disease, N2/N3 nodal involvement
#3 CKD - tolerated sedation without issues

PLAN:
#1 Oncology referral for systemic therapy planning
#2 Molecular profiling from station 4R sample
#3 F/u renal function post-procedure
