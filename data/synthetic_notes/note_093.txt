BRONCHOSCOPY NOTE - COMBINED EBUS + EMN

University Hospital Bronchoscopy Suite

**PT:** Nakamura, Kenji | 67M | MRN 9384756
**DATE:** 01/23/2025
**PHYSICIANS:** Dr. Sarah Williams (Attending), Dr. Marcus Johnson (Fellow)
**ANESTHESIA:** MAC team - Dr. Lisa Park

**INDICATION:**
LUL mass 4.2cm + mediastinal adenopathy. Staging and tissue diagnosis needed.

**PROCEDURES:**
- EBUS-TBNA of mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes
- Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy
- Radial EBUS
- Transbronchial biopsy of LUL mass

**CLINICAL CONTEXT:**
Patient with 50 py smoking history, now with large LUL mass crossing fissure. PET shows: primary lesion SUV 11.3, station 5 (AP window) 2.4cm SUV 6.7, station 7 1.9cm SUV 5.2, station 10L 1.6cm SUV 4.8. Need staging before treatment planning.

**MEDICATIONS/ANESTHESIA:**
Moderate-deep sedation. Propofol infusion (bolus 200mg, then 75-150 mcg/kg/min). Fentanyl 125mcg IV. Patient maintained spontaneous respirations with supplemental O2 via NC.

**PART 1 - EBUS EXAMINATION:**

EBUS scope (Olympus) inserted through mouth.

LYMPH NODE SURVEY:

*Station 2R:* 8mm - not sampled (too small)

*Station 4R:* 11mm - appears reactive, not sampled

*Station 4L:* 14mm - appears reactive, not sampled

*Station 5 (AP window):*
- Measured: 24mm x 18mm
- Echo: Hypoechoic, heterogeneous
- Shape: Oval with irregular borders
- Blood flow: Present on Doppler
- **Sampled: 22G needle x 5 passes**
- ROSE: "Positive for malignancy, NSCLC"

*Station 7 (subcarinal):*
- Measured: 18mm x 15mm
- Echo: Hypoechoic, fairly homogeneous
- **Sampled: 22G needle x 4 passes**
- ROSE: "Positive for malignancy, similar to station 5"

*Station 10L (left hilar):*
- Measured: 15mm x 12mm
- Echo: Hypoechoic
- **Sampled: 22G needle x 3 passes**
- ROSE: "Positive for malignancy"

*Station 11L:* Not well-visualized on EBUS

**PART 2 - EMN BRONCHOSCOPY OF PRIMARY TUMOR:**

EBUS scope removed. Standard therapeutic bronchoscope (Olympus BF-1TH190) inserted.

Initial airway survey:
- Trachea: patent, no extrinsic compression
- Carina: sharp
- LUL orifice: partially narrowed by external compression from mass
- LUL segments: able to pass scope, but narrowed
- Remainder of left and right bronchial tree: patent

**EMN Navigation:**
SuperDimension system used. CT from 01/10/2025 uploaded.

Target: LUL mass (posterior segment component - anterior component has endobronchial extension)

Registration: Automatic + manual verification. 8 points confirmed. System accuracy indicator >90%.

Locatable guide advanced to LUL posterior segment. Navigation suggested tool within 9mm of target center.

**Radial EBUS:**
- Pattern: Concentric initially, then lost signal (likely probe too close to chest wall/fissure)
- Repositioned catheter 8mm proximally
- New pattern: Eccentric but visualizing lesion
- Lesion: Very heterogeneous, areas of necrosis likely present
- Size by ultrasound: >35mm

**Sampling via guide sheath:**
- Forceps biopsies: 9 specimens (some friable, concerning for necrosis)
- Brush cytology: 4 passes
- Needle aspiration: 21G needle, 3 passes
- BAL: 80cc in, 35cc returned

**ROSE (Primary Tumor):**
"Adequate sample. Malignant cells present. Poorly differentiated carcinoma, likely squamous cell carcinoma based on cytologic features. Differs from adenocarcinoma pattern sometimes seen - recommend awaiting permanent sections for final classification."

**ADDITIONAL SAMPLING - ENDOBRONCHIAL COMPONENT:**

Returned to LUL orifice. Visible endobronchial tumor on anterior segment ostium.

Direct endobronchial biopsies: 4 specimens using standard forceps.

ROSE: "Squamous cell carcinoma confirmed"

Minimal bleeding from endobronchial biopsy site. Resolved with gentle suction.

**COMPLETION:**

Total procedure time: 67 minutes

Patient tolerated well. No complications. Extubated to room air. Stable.

**EBL:** ~15mL

**SPECIMENS:**
1. Station 5 TBNA x5
2. Station 7 TBNA x4
3. Station 10L TBNA x3
4. LUL mass TBBx x9 (via EMN)
5. LUL mass brushings x4
6. LUL mass needle aspirate x3
7. LUL mass BAL
8. LUL endobronchial tumor biopsies x4

**ROSE SUMMARY:**
- N2 disease present (stations 5, 7)
- N1 disease present (station 10L)
- Primary tumor: Squamous cell carcinoma

**IMPRESSION:**
Stage IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of LUL (T3-4 given size/fissure involvement, N2-3, M0). Not surgical candidate. Needs definitive chemoradiation vs clinical trial.

**PLAN:**
- Brain MRI for staging
- Tumor board discussion
- Medical onc + radiation onc consults
- F/u IP clinic 1 week

CXR ordered post-procedure - prelim read shows no PTX.
